"elerated by linearly polarized intense laser fields, we find for the first time that the transverse momentum distribution of photoelectrons can be well fitted by a squared zeroth-order Bessel function because of the quantum interference effect of Glory rescattering. The characteristic of the Bessel function is determined by the common angular momentum of a bunch of semiclassical paths termed as Glory trajectories, which are launched with different nonzero initial transverse momenta distributed on a specific circle in the momentum plane and finally deflected to the same asymptotic momentum, which is along the polarization direction, through post-tunneling rescattering. Glory rescattering theory (GRT) based on the semiclassical path-integral formalism is developed to address this effect quantitatively. Our theory can resolve the long-standing discrepancies between existing theories and experiments on the fringe location, predict the sudden transition of the fringe structure in holographic patterns, and shed light on the quantum interference aspects of low-energy structures in strong-field atomic ionization."

Quantum Annealing for Gaussian Mixture Models,
Abstract: We propose a modified expectation-maximization algorithm by introducing the
concept of quantum annealing, which we call the deterministic quantum annealing
expectation-maximization (DQAEM) algorithm. The expectation-maximization (EM)
algorithm is an established algorithm to compute maximum likelihood estimates
and applied to many practical applications. However, it is known that EM
heavily depends on initial values and its estimates are sometimes trapped by
local optima. To solve such a problem, quantum annealing (QA) was proposed as a
novel optimization approach motivated by quantum mechanics. By employing QA, we
then formulate DQAEM and present a theorem that supports its stability.
Finally, we demonstrate numerical simulations to confirm its efficiency."

*   We demonstrate that spatially transformed adversarial examples are

*   We show that our spatial transformation based perturbation can result in
    large $\mathcal{L}_p$ distance measures, but still produces realistic
    adversarial examples.
*   We visualize the spatial transformation based perturbation for different

"elerating the learning of RNNs by speeding up training time and
showing convergence to a global optimum. Also, this work proposes a
self-organized subspace projection method for RC networks which uses
information from the beginning of the episode to define a cluster to which the
episode belongs to. This assigned cluster defines a particular binary input
that shifts the operating point of the reservoir to a subspace of trajectories
for the duration of the episode. This new method is shown to turn the RC model
robust in performance with respect to varying combination of reservoir
parameters, such as spectral radius and leak rate, when compared to a standard
RC network."

electronic energy into the lattice may lead to observable target modifications
such as phase transitions and damage formation. Transient kinetics of material
excitation and relaxation under FEL or SHI irradiation are comparatively
discussed. The same origin for the electronic and atomic relaxation in both
cases is demonstrated. Differences in these kinetics introduced by the
geometrical effects ({\mu}m-size of a laser spot vs nm-size of an ion track)
and initial irradiation (photoabsorption vs an ion impact) are analyzed. The
basic mechanisms of electron transport and electron-lattice coupling are
addressed. Appropriate models and their limitations are presented.
Possibilities of thermal and nonthermal melting of materials under FEL and SHI

Abstract: The discovery of the exoplanet Kepler-62f has generated a lot of excitement

We present a study of the stellar activity of the host star Kepler-62, which is
a G-type star with a mass of about 0.64 Msun. We show that the star is a
solar-type star with a relatively high level of activity, which may have
implications for the habitability of the planet."

"elson junctions: Chern numbers, conductances and supercurrents,
Abstract: We consider mesoscopic four-terminal Josephson junctions and study emergent
topological properties of the Andreev subgap bands. We use symmetry-constrained
analysis for Wigner-Dyson classes of scattering matrices to derive band
dispersions. When scattering matrix of the normal region connecting
superconducting leads is energy-independent, the determinant formula for
Andreev spectrum can be reduced to a palindromic equation that admits a
complete analytical solution. Band topology manifests with an appearance of the
Weyl nodes which serve as monopoles of finite Berry curvature. The
corresponding fluxes are quantified by Chern numbers that translate into a
quantized nonlocal conductance that we compute explicitly for the
time-reversal-symmetric scattering matrix. The topological regime can be also
identified by supercurrents as Josephson current-phase relationships exhibit
pronounced nonanalytic behavior and discontinuities near Weyl points that can
be controllably accessed in experiments."

" detectors of the model were analyzed. The performance of the model was evaluated based on the costs of
the waiting times of each of the agents at the pre-defined spatial point of
handover. The model was tested for two cases of dynamic H-R coordination
scenarios. Results indicate that this analytical model can be used as a tool
for designing an H-R system that optimizes the agent waiting time thereby
increasing the joint-efficiency of the system and making coordination fluent
