    Title: Covariances, Robustness, and Variational Bayes,
    Abstract: Mean-field Variational Bayes (MFVB) is an approximate Bayesian posterior
    inference technique that is increasingly popular due to its fast runtimes on
    large-scale datasets. However, even when MFVB provides accurate posterior means
    for certain parameters, it often mis-estimates variances and covariances.
    Furthermore, prior robustness measures have remained undeveloped for MFVB. By
    deriving a simple formula for the effect of infinitesimal model perturbations
    on MFVB posterior means, we provide both improved covariance estimates and
    local robustness measures for MFVB, thus greatly expanding the practical
    usefulness of MFVB posterior approximations. The estimates for MFVB posterior
    covariances rely on a result from the classical Bayesian robustness literature
    relating derivatives of posterior expectations to posterior covariances and
    include the Laplace approximation as a special case. Our key condition is that
    the MFVB approximation provides good estimates of a select subset of posterior
    means---an assumption that has been shown to hold in many practical settings.
    In our experiments, we demonstrate that"

    Title: Parallelism, Concurrency and Distribution in Constraint Handling Rules: A Survey,
    Abstract: Constraint Handling Rules is an effective concurrent declarative programming
    language and a versatile computational logic formalism. CHR programs consist of
    guarded reactive rules that transform multisets of constraints. One of the main
    features of CHR is its inherent concurrency. Intuitively, rules can be applied
    to parts of a multiset in parallel. In this comprehensive survey, we give an
    overview of concurrent and parallel as well as distributed CHR semantics,
    standard and more exotic, that have been proposed over the years at various
    levels of refinement. These semantics range from the abstract to the concrete.
    They are related by formal soundness results. Their correctness is established
    as correspondence between parallel and sequential computations. We present
    common concise sample CHR programs that have been widely used in experiments
    and benchmarks. We review parallel CHR implementations in software and
    hardware. The experimental results obtained show a consistent parallel speedup.
    Most implementations are available online. The CHR formalism can also be used
    to implement and reason with models for concurrency. To this end, the Software

    Title: The Query Complexity of Cake Cutting,
    Abstract: We study the query complexity of cake cutting and give lower and upper bounds for computing approximately envy-free, perfect, and equitable allocations with the minimum number of cuts. The lower bounds are tight for computing connected envy-free allocations among n=3 players and for computing perfect and equitable allocations with minimum number of cuts between n=2 players. We also formalize moving knife procedures and show that a large subclass of this family, which captures all the known moving knife procedures, can be simulated efficiently with arbitrarily small error in the Robertson-Webb query model.

    Title: A note on the fundamental group of Kodaira fibrations,
    Abstract: The fundamental group $\pi$ of a Kodaira fibration is, by definition, the
    extension of a surface group $\Pi_b$ by another surface group $\Pi_g$, i.e. \[
    1 \rightarrow \Pi_g \rightarrow \pi \rightarrow \Pi_b \rightarrow 1. \]
    Conversely, we can inquire about what conditions need to be satisfied by a
    group of that sort in order to be the fundamental group of a Kodaira fibration.
    In this short note we collect some restriction on the image of the classifying
    map $m \colon \Pi_b \to \Gamma_g$ in terms of the coinvariant homology of
    $\Pi_g$. In particular, we observe that if $\pi$ is the fundamental group of a
    Kodaira fibration with relative irregularity $g-s$, then $g \leq 1+ 6s$, and we
    show that this effectively constrains the possible choices for $\pi$, namely
    that there are group extensions as above that fail to satisfy this bound, hence
    cannot be the fundamental"

Title: A New Approach to the Analysis of Financial Time Series,
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new method for analyzing financial time series data. The approach combines elements of machine learning and statistical analysis to predict future market movements. We apply our method to historical stock price data and show that it outperforms traditional models in terms of accuracy. The methodology involves training a neural network on past price movements and using it to forecast future prices. We also discuss the challenges of applying such methods in real-world scenarios, including data quality and model interpretability."

    Title: Utilizing artificial neural networks to predict demand for weather-sensitive products at retail stores,
    Abstract: One key requirement for effective supply chain management is the quality of
    its inventory management. Various inventory management methods are typically
    employed for different types of products based on their demand patterns,
    product attributes, and supply network. In this paper, our goal is to develop
    robust demand prediction methods for weather sensitive products at retail
    stores. We employ historical datasets from Walmart, whose customers and markets
    are often exposed to extreme weather events which can have a huge impact on
    sales regarding the affected stores and products. We want to accurately predict
    the sales of 111 potentially weather-sensitive products around the time of
    major weather events at 45 of Walmart retails locations in the U.S.
    Intuitively, we may expect an uptick in the sales of umbrellas before a big
    thunderstorm, but it is difficult for replenishment managers to predict the
    level of inventory needed to avoid being out-of-stock or overstock during and
    after that storm. While they rely on a variety of vendor tools to predict sales
    around extreme weather events, they mostly"

    Title: Characterizing Exoplanet Habitability,
    Abstract: A habitable exoplanet is a world that can maintain stable liquid water on its
    surface. Techniques and approaches to characterizing such worlds are essential,
    as performing a census of Earth-like planets that may or may not have life will
    inform our understanding of how frequently life originates and is sustained on
    worlds other than our own. Observational techniques like high contrast imaging
    and transit spectroscopy can reveal key indicators of habitability for
    exoplanets. Both polarization measurements and specular reflectance from oceans
    (also known as ""glint"") can provide direct evidence for surface liquid water,
    while constraining surface pressure and temperature (from moderate resolution
    spectra) can indicate liquid water stability. Indirect evidence for
    habitability can come from a variety of sources, including observations of
    variability due to weather, surface mapping studies, and/or measurements of
    water vapor or cloud profiles that indicate condensation near a surface.
    Approaches to making the types of measurements that indicate habitability are
    diverse, and have different considerations for the required wavelength range,
    spectral resolution, maximum noise levels, stellar host temperature"

Title: PRE-render Content Using Tiles (PRECUT). 1. Large-Scale Compound-Target Relationship Analyses,
Abstract: Visualizing a complex network is computationally intensive process and
depends heavily on the number of components in the network. One way to solve
this problem is not to render the network in real time. PRE-render Content
Using Tiles (PRECUT) is a process to convert any complex network into a
pre-rendered network. Tiles are generated from pre-rendered images at different
zoom levels, and navigating the network simply becomes delivering relevant
tiles. PRECUT is exemplified by performing large-scale compound-target
relationship analyses. Matched molecular pair (MMP) networks were created using
compounds and the target class description found in the ChEMBL database. To
visualize MMP networks, the MMP network viewer has been implemented in COMBINE
and as a web application, hosted at this http URL.

    Title: Understanding Deep Learning Requires Rethinking Generalization,
    Abstract: Despite the massive success of deep neural networks, the fundamental question of why they generalize so well remains elusive. In this work, we propose a new perspective on understanding generalization in deep learning. We argue that the key to generalization lies in the implicit constraints imposed by the optimization process on the learned functions. We provide theoretical insights into these constraints and show how they can lead to good generalization performance. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of our findings for the design of better optimization algorithms and architectures."

    Title: Non-Asymptotic Analysis of Fractional Langevin Monte Carlo for Non-Convex Optimization,
    Abstract: Recent studies on diffusion-based sampling methods have shown that Langevin
    Monte Carlo (LMC) algorithms can be beneficial for non-convex optimization, and
    rigorous theoretical guarantees have been proven for both asymptotic and
    finite-time regimes. Algorithmically, LMC-based algorithms resemble the
    well-known gradient descent (GD) algorithm, where the GD recursion is perturbed
    by an additive Gaussian noise whose variance has a particular form. Fractional
    Langevin Monte Carlo (FLMC) is a recently proposed extension of LMC, where the
    Gaussian noise is replaced by a heavy-tailed {\alpha}-stable noise. As opposed
    to its Gaussian counterpart, these heavy-tailed perturbations can incur large
    jumps and it has been empirically demonstrated that the choice of
    {\alpha}-stable noise can provide several advantages in modern machine learning
    problems, both in optimization and sampling contexts. However, as opposed to
    LMC, only asymptotic convergence properties of FLMC have been yet established.

    Title: Unveiling ADP-binding sites and channels in respiratory complexes: Validation of Murburn concept as a holistic explanation for oxidative phosphorylation,
    Abstract: Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (mOxPhos) makes ATP, the energy currency of life. Chemiosmosis, a proton-centric mechanism, advocates that Complex V harnesses a transmembrane potential (TMP) for ATP synthesis. This perception of cellular respiration requires oxygen to stay tethered at Complex IV (an association inhibited by cyanide) and diffusible reactive oxygen species (DROS) are considered wasteful and toxic products. With new mechanistic insights on heme and flavin enzymes, an oxygen or DROS-centric explanation (called murburn concept) was recently proposed for mOxPhos. In the new mechanism, TMP is not directly harnessed, protons are a rate-limiting reactant, and DROS within the matrix serve as the chemical coupling agents that directly link NADH oxidation with ATP synthesis. Herein, we report multiple ADP binding sites and solvent-accessible DROS channels in respiratory proteins, which validate the oxygen or DROS-centric power generation (ATP synthesis) system in mOxPh"

Title: Birth of a subaqueous barchan dune,
Abstract: Barchan dunes are crescentic shape dunes with horns pointing downstream. The
present paper reports the formation of subaqueous barchan dunes from initially
conical heaps in a rectangular channel. Because the most unique feature of a
barchan dune is its horns, we associate the timescale for the appearance of
horns to the formation of a barchan dune. A granular heap initially conical was
placed on the bottom wall of a closed conduit and it was entrained by a water
flow in turbulent regime. After a certain time, horns appear and grow, until an
equilibrium length is reached. Our results show the existence of the timescales
$0.5t_c$ and $2.5t_c$ for the appearance and equilibrium of horns,
respectively, where $t_c$ is a characteristic time that scales with the grains
diameter, gravity acceleration, densities of the fluid and grains, and shear
and threshold velocities.

    Title: Deep Multi-User Reinforcement Learning for Distributed Dynamic Spectrum Access,
    Abstract: We consider the problem of dynamic spectrum access for network utility
    maximization in multichannel wireless networks. The shared bandwidth is divided
    into K orthogonal channels. In the beginning of each time slot, each user
    selects a channel and transmits a packet with a certain transmission
    probability. After each time slot, each user that has transmitted a packet
    receives a local observation indicating whether its packet was successfully
    delivered or not (i.e., ACK signal). The objective is a multi-user strategy for
    accessing the spectrum that maximizes a certain network utility in a
    distributed manner without online coordination or message exchanges between
    users. Obtaining an optimal solution for the spectrum access problem is
    computationally expensive in general due to the large state space and partial
    observability of the states. To tackle this problem, we develop a novel
    distributed dynamic spectrum access algorithm based on deep multi-user
    reinforcement learning. Specifically, at each time slot, each user maps its
    current state to spectrum access actions based on a trained deep-Q network used
    to maximize the objective function. Game theoret"

Here the results are presented as cap product pairings, which will be elements of a suitable homology theory, rather than characteristic numbers as would be the case when taking Kronecker products once Poincaré duality is defined. We further consider possible applications and examples including branched covering maps, singular varieties involving virtual tangent bundles, the Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson class, the homology L-class, generalized signature, and the cohomology signature class.

    Title: Surface tension of flowing soap films,
    Abstract: The surface tension of flowing soap films is measured with respect to the

    the surface tension and the tension of the wire. We find the surface tension of
    our soap films increases when the film is relatively thin or made of soap
    solution of low concentration, otherwise it approaches an asymptotic value 30
    mN/m. A simple adsorption model with only two parameters describes our
    observations reasonably well. With our measurements, we are also able to
    measure Gibbs elasticity for our soap film.

Title: Deep Learning for Predicting Protein-Protein Interactions,
Abstract: Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play a crucial role in cellular processes. However, experimentally determining PPIs is time-consuming and expensive. In this study, we propose a deep learning approach to predict PPIs using only sequence information. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating the potential of deep learning in understanding complex biological systems."

    Title: HybridNet: Classification and Reconstruction Cooperation for Semi-Supervised Learning,
    Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new model for leveraging unlabeled data to improve generalization performances of image classifiers: a two-branch encoder-decoder architecture called HybridNet. The first branch receives supervision signal and is dedicated to the extraction of invariant class-related representations. The second branch is fully unsupervised and dedicated to model information discarded by the first branch to reconstruct input data. To further support the expected behavior of our model, we propose an original training objective. It favors stability in the discriminative branch and complementarity between the learned representations in the two branches. HybridNet is able to outperform state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-10, SVHN and STL-10 in various semi-supervised settings. In addition, visualizations and ablation studies validate our contributions and the behavior of the model on both CIFAR-10 and STL-10 datasets.

    Title: On the Status of the Measurement Problem: Recalling the Relativistic Transactional Interpretation,
    Abstract: In view of a resurgence of concern about the measurement problem, it is
    pointed out that the Relativistic Transactional Interpretation (RTI) remedies
    issues previously considered as drawbacks or refutations of the original TI.
    Specifically, once one takes into account relativistic processes that are not
    representable at the non-relativistic level (such as particle creation and
    annihilation, and virtual propagation), absorption is quantitatively defined in
    unambiguous physical terms. In addition, specifics of the relativistic
    transactional model demonstrate that the Maudlin `contingent absorber'
    challenge to the original TI cannot even be mounted: basic features of
    established relativistic field theories (in particular, the asymmetry between
    field sources and the bosonic fields, and the fact that slow-moving bound
    states, such as atoms, are not offer waves) dictate that the `slow-moving offer
    wave' required for the challenge scenario cannot exist. It is concluded that
    issues previously considered obstacles for TI are no longer legitimately viewed
    as such"

    Title: Estimating Achievable Range of Ground Robots Operating on Single Battery Discharge for Operational Efficacy Amelioration,
    Abstract: Mobile robots are increasingly being used to assist with active pursuit and
    law enforcement. One major limitation for such missions is the resource
    (battery) allocated to the robot. Factors like nature and agility of evader,
    terrain over which pursuit is being carried out, plausible traversal velocity
    and the amount of necessary data to be collected all influence how long the
    robot can last in the field and how far it can travel. In this paper, we
    develop an analytical model that analyzes the energy utilization for a variety
    of components mounted on a robot to estimate the maximum operational range
    achievable by the robot operating on a single battery discharge. We categorize
    the major consumers of energy as: 1.) ancillary robotic functions such as
    computation, communication, sensing etc., and 2.) maneuvering which involves
    propulsion, steering etc. Both these consumers draw power from the common power
    source but the achievable range is largely affected by the proportion of power
    available for maneuvering. For this case"

    Title: Geometric Enclosing Networks,
    Abstract: Training model to generate data has increasingly attracted research attention
    and become important in modern world applications. We propose in this paper a
    new geometry-based optimization approach to address this problem. Orthogonal to
    current state-of-the-art density-based approaches, most notably VAE and GAN, we
    present a fresh new idea that borrows the principle of minimal enclosing ball
    to train a generator G\left(\bz\right) in such a way that both training and
    generated data, after being mapped to the feature space, are enclosed in the
    same sphere. We develop theory to guarantee that the mapping is bijective so
    that its inverse from feature space to data space results in expressive
    nonlinear contours to describe the data manifold, hence ensuring data generated
    are also lying on the data manifold learned from training data. Our model
    enjoys a nice geometric interpretation, hence termed Geometric Enclosing
    Networks (GEN), and possesses some key advantages over its rivals, namely
    simple and easy-to-control optimization formulation, avoidance of mode
    collapsing and efficiently learn data manifold representation in a completely
    unsupervised manner"

    Title: Out-degree reducing partitions of digraphs,
Abstract: Let $k$ be a fixed integer. We determine the complexity of finding a
$p$-partition $(V_1, \dots, V_p)$ of the vertex set of a given digraph such
that the maximum out-degree of each of the digraphs induced by $V_i$, ($1\leq
i\leq p$) is at least $k$ smaller than the maximum out-degree of $D$. We show
that this problem is polynomial-time solvable when $p\geq 2k$ and ${\cal
NP}$-complete otherwise. The result for $k=1$ and $p=2$ answers a question
posed in \cite{bangTCS636}. We also determine, for all fixed non-negative
integers $k_1,k_2,p$, the complexity of deciding whether a given digraph of
maximum out-degree $p$ has a $2$-partition $(V_1,V_2)$ such that the digraph
induced by $V_i$ has maximum out-degree at most $k_i$ for $i\in [2]"

    Title: Unsupervised Learning of Mixture Regression Models for Longitudinal Data,
    Abstract: This paper is concerned with learning of mixture regression models for
    individuals that are measured repeatedly. The adjective ""unsupervised"" implies
    that the number of mixing components is unknown and has to be determined,
    ideally by data driven tools. For this purpose, a novel penalized method is
    proposed to simultaneously select the number of mixing components and to
    estimate the mixing proportions and unknown parameters in the models. The
    proposed method is capable of handling both continuous and discrete responses
    by only requiring the first two moment conditions of the model distribution. It
    is shown to be consistent in both selecting the number of components and
    estimating the mixing proportions and unknown regression parameters. Further, a
    modified EM algorithm is developed to seamlessly integrate model selection and
    estimation. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the finite sample
    performance of the proposed procedure. And it is further illustrated via an
    analysis of a primary biliary cirrhosis data set.

    Title: Discovery of Extreme [OIII]+H$β$ Emitting Galaxies Tracing an Overdensity at z~3.5 in CDF-South,
    Abstract: Using deep multi-wavelength photometry of galaxies from ZFOURGE, we group
    galaxies at $2.5<z<4.0$ by the shape of their spectral energy distributions
    (SEDs). We identify a population of galaxies with excess emission in the
    $K_s$-band, which corresponds to [OIII]+H$\beta$ emission at $2.95<z<3.65$.
    This population includes 78% of the bluest galaxies with UV slopes steeper than
    $\beta = -2$. We de-redshift and scale this photometry to build two composite
    SEDs, enabling us to measure equivalent widths of these Extreme [OIII]+H$\beta$
    Emission Line Galaxies (EELGs) at $z\sim3.5$. We identify 60 galaxies that
    comprise a composite SED with [OIII]+H$\beta$ rest-frame equivalent width of

    Title: Adversarial Pseudo Healthy Synthesis Needs Pathology Factorization,
    Abstract: Pseudo healthy synthesis, i.e. the creation of a subject-specific `healthy'
    image from a pathological one, could be helpful in tasks such as anomaly
    detection, understanding changes induced by pathology and disease or even as
    data augmentation. We treat this task as a factor decomposition problem: we aim
    to separate what appears to be healthy and where disease is (as a map). The two
    factors are then recombined (by a network) to reconstruct the input disease
    image. We train our models in an adversarial way using either paired or
    unpaired settings, where we pair disease images and maps (as segmentation
    masks) when available. We quantitatively evaluate the quality of pseudo healthy
    images. We show in a series of experiments, performed in ISLES and BraTS
    datasets, that our method is better than conditional GAN and CycleGAN,
    highlighting challenges in using adversarial methods in the image translation
    task of pseudo healthy image generation.

Title: Optimal Gossip Algorithms for Exact and Approximate Quantile Computations,
Abstract: This paper gives drastically faster gossip algorithms to compute exact and
approximate quantiles.
Gossip algorithms, which allow each node to contact a uniformly random other
node in each round, have been intensely studied and been adopted in many
applications due to their fast convergence and their robustness to failures.
Kempe et al. [FOCS'03] gave gossip algorithms to compute important aggregate
statistics if every node is given a value. In particular, they gave a beautiful
$O(\log n + \log \frac{1}{\epsilon})$ round algorithm to $\epsilon$-approximate
the sum of all values and an $O(\log^2 n)$ round algorithm to compute the exact
$\phi$-quantile, i.e., the the $\lceil \phi n \rceil$ smallest value.
We give an quadratically faster and in fact optimal gossip algorithm for the
exact $\phi$-quantile problem which runs in $O(\log n)$ rounds. We furthermore
show that one can achieve an exponential speedup if one allows for an
$\epsilon$-approx"

    Title: The Australian PCEHR system: Ensuring Privacy and Security through an Improved Access Control Mechanism,
    Abstract: An Electronic Health Record (EHR) is designed to store diverse data accurately from a range of health care providers and to capture the status of a patient by a range of health care providers across time. Realising the numerous benefits of the system, EHR adoption is growing globally and many countries invest heavily in electronic health systems. In Australia, the Government invested $467 million to build key components of the Personally Controlled Electronic Health Record (PCEHR) system in July 2012. However, in the last three years, the uptake from individuals and health care providers has not been satisfactory. Unauthorised access of the PCEHR was one of the major barriers. We propose an improved access control model for the PCEHR system to resolve the unauthorised access issue. We discuss the unauthorised access issue with real examples and present a potential solution to overcome the issue to make the PCEHR system a success in Australia.

    Title: Threshold Constraints with Guarantees for Parity Objectives in Markov Decision Processes,
    Abstract: The beyond worst-case synthesis problem was introduced recently by Bruyère
    et al. [BFRR14]: it aims at building system controllers that provide strict
    worst-case performance guarantees against an antagonistic environment while
    ensuring higher expected performance against a stochastic model of the
    environment. Our work extends the framework of [BFRR14] and follow-up papers,
    which focused on quantitative objectives, by addressing the case of
    $\omega$-regular conditions encoded as parity objectives, a natural way to
    represent functional requirements of systems.
    We build strategies that satisfy a main parity objective on all plays, while
    ensuring a secondary one with sufficient probability. This setting raises new
    challenges in comparison to quantitative objectives, as one cannot easily mix
    different strategies without endangering the functional properties of the
    system. We establish that, for all variants of this problem, deciding the
    existence of a strategy lies in ${\sf NP} \cap {\sf coNP}$, the same complexity
    class as classical parity games. Hence, our framework provides additional

    Title: The affine approach to homogeneous geodesics in homogeneous Finsler spaces,
    Abstract: In a recent paper, it was claimed that any homogeneous Finsler space of odd
    dimension admits a homogeneous geodesic through any point. For the proof, the
    algebraic method dealing with the reductive decomposition of the Lie algebra of
    the isometry group was used. However, the proof contains a serious gap. In the
    present paper, homogeneous geodesics in Finsler homogeneous spaces are studied
    using the affine method, which was developed in earlier papers by the author.
    The mentioned statement is proved correctly and it is further proved that any
    homogeneous Berwald space or homogeneous reversible Finsler space admits a
    homogeneous geodesic through any point.

    particular, they are not isomorphic to free group factors. This result is
    obtained by establishing a spectral regularity result for the edge reversing
    operator on the quantum Cayley tree associated to \(\mathbb{F}O_N\), and
    combining this result with a recent free entropy dimension rank theorem of Jung

    Title: Semi-equivelar maps on the torus are Archimedean,
    Abstract: If the face-cycles at all the vertices in a map on a surface are of the same type, then the map is called semi-equivelar. There are eleven types of Archimedean tilings on the plane. All the Archimedean tilings are semi-equivelar maps. If a map \( X \) on the torus is a quotient of an Archimedean tiling on the plane, then the map \( X \) is semi-equivelar. We show that each semi-equivelar map on the torus is a quotient of an Archimedean tiling on the plane. Vertex-transitive maps are semi-equivelar maps. We know that four types of semi-equivelar maps on the torus are always vertex-transitive, and there are examples of other seven types of semi-equivelar maps which are not vertex-transitive. We show that the number of \(\text{Aut}(Y)\)-orbits of vertices for any semi-equivelar map \( Y \) on the torus is at most six. In fact, the number of orbits is at most three except one type"

    Title: Modeling the Dynamics of Gene Regulatory Networks Using Differential Equations,
    Abstract: Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) play a crucial role in controlling gene expression levels within cells. In this study, we present a mathematical model using differential equations to describe the dynamics of GRNs. We focus on the interactions between genes and their products, and how these interactions influence gene expression over time. The model is validated using experimental data from various studies, demonstrating its ability to predict the temporal changes in gene expression accurately. We also discuss the implications of our findings for understanding complex biological systems and potential applications in biotechnology and medicine."

Title: Arrow Categories of Monoidal Model Categories,
Abstract: We prove that the arrow category of a monoidal model category, equipped with
the pushout product monoidal structure and the projective model structure, is a
monoidal model category. This answers a question posed by Mark Hovey, and has
the important consequence that it allows for the consideration of a monoidal
product in cubical homotopy theory. As illustrations we include numerous
examples of non-cofibrantly generated monoidal model categories, including
chain complexes, small categories, topological spaces, and pro-categories.

    Title: HoloScope: Topology-and-Spike Aware Fraud Detection,
    Abstract: As online fraudsters invest more resources, including purchasing large pools
    of fake user accounts and dedicated IPs, fraudulent attacks become less obvious
    and their detection becomes increasingly challenging. Existing approaches such
    as average degree maximization suffer from the bias of including more nodes
    than necessary, resulting in lower accuracy and increased need for manual
    verification. Hence, we propose HoloScope, which uses information from graph
    topology and temporal spikes to more accurately detect groups of fraudulent
    users. In terms of graph topology, we introduce ""contrast suspiciousness,"" a
    dynamic weighting approach, which allows us to more accurately detect
    fraudulent blocks, particularly low-density blocks. In terms of temporal
    spikes, HoloScope takes into account the sudden bursts and drops of fraudsters'
    attacking patterns. In addition, we provide theoretical bounds for how much
    this increases the time cost needed for fraudsters to conduct adversarial
    attacks. Additionally, from the perspective of ratings, HoloScope incorporates
    the deviation of rating scores in order to catch fraudsters more accurately.
    Moreover, HoloScope has a concise"

    Title: Convexity of level lines of Martin functions and applications,
    Abstract: Let $\Omega$ be an unbounded domain in $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^{d}.$ A
    positive harmonic function $u$ on $\Omega$ that vanishes on the boundary of
    $\Omega$ is called a Martin function. In this note, we show that, when $\Omega$
    is convex, the superlevel sets of a Martin function are also convex. As a
    consequence we obtain that if in addition $\Omega$ is symmetric, then the
    maximum of any Martin function along a slice $\Omega\cap
    (\{t\}\times\mathbb{R}^d)$ is attained at $(t,0).$

Title: Perfect Edge Domination: Hard and Solvable Cases,
Abstract: Let \( G \) be an undirected graph. An edge of \( G \) dominates itself and all edges
adjacent to it. A subset \( E' \) of edges of \( G \) is an edge dominating set of \( G \),
if every edge of the graph is dominated by some edge of \( E' \). We say that \( E' \)
is a perfect edge dominating set of \( G \), if every edge not in \( E' \) is dominated
by exactly one edge of \( E' \). The perfect edge dominating problem is to
determine a least cardinality perfect edge dominating set of \( G \). For this
problem, we describe two NP-completeness proofs, for the classes of claw-free
graphs of degree at most 3, and for bounded degree graphs, of maximum degree at
most \( d \geq 3 \) and large girth. In contrast, we prove that the problem admits
an \( O(n) \) time solution, for cubic claw-free graphs. In addition, we prove a
complexity dichotomy theorem for the perfect edge domination"

Title: Deep Learning for Predicting Protein-Protein Interactions from Contact Maps,
Abstract: Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play a crucial role in cellular processes. 
However, identifying these interactions experimentally is time-consuming and expensive. 
Deep learning models have shown promising results in predicting PPIs using various types of data. 
In this work, we propose a deep learning approach that leverages contact maps to predict PPIs. 
Contact maps provide information about the spatial proximity of residues in proteins, 
which can be indicative of potential interaction sites. 
Our model is designed to learn complex patterns from contact maps, 
enabling accurate predictions of PPIs without the need for extensive experimental validation. 
We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness compared to existing methods."

    Title: Time-Resolved High Spectral Resolution Observation of 2MASSW J0746425+200032AB,
    Abstract: Many brown dwarfs exhibit photometric variability at levels from tenths to tens of percents. The photometric variability is related to magnetic activity or patchy cloud coverage, characteristic of brown dwarfs near the L-T transition. Time-resolved spectral monitoring of brown dwarfs provides diagnostics of cloud distribution and condensate properties. However, current time-resolved spectral studies of brown dwarfs are limited to low spectral resolution (R~100) with the exception of the study of Luhman 16 AB at resolution of 100,000 using the VLT+CRIRES. This work yielded the first map of brown dwarf surface inhomogeneity, highlighting the importance and unique contribution of high spectral resolution observations. Here, we report on the time-resolved high spectral resolution observations of a nearby brown dwarf binary, 2MASSW J0746425+200032AB. We find no coherent spectral variability that is modulated with rotation. Based on simulations we conclude that the coverage of a"

Title: One can hear the Euler characteristic of a simplicial complex,
Abstract: We prove that the number p of positive eigenvalues of the connection
Laplacian L of a finite abstract simplicial complex G matches the number b of
even dimensional simplices in G and that the number n of negative eigenvalues
matches the number f of odd-dimensional simplices in G. The Euler
characteristic X(G) of G therefore can be spectrally described as X(G)=b-f.
This is in contrast to the more classical Hodge Laplacian H which acts on the
same Hilbert space, where X(G) is not yet known to be accessible from the
spectrum of H. Given an ordering of G coming from a build-up as a CW complex,
every simplex x in G is now associated to a unique eigenvector of L and the
correspondence is computable. The Euler characteristic is now not only the
potential energy summing over all g(x,y) with g=L^{-1} but also agrees with a
logarithmic energy tr(log(i L)) 2/(i pi) of the spectrum of L. We also give
here examples of L-isospectral"

    Title: Knowledge Reuse for Customization: Metamodels in an Open Design Community for 3d Printing,
    Abstract: Theories of knowledge reuse posit two distinct processes: reuse for replication and reuse for innovation. We identify another distinct process, reuse for customization. Reuse for customization is a process in which designers manipulate the parameters of metamodels to produce models that fulfill their personal needs. We test hypotheses about reuse for customization in Thingiverse, a community of designers that shares files for three-dimensional printing. 3D metamodels are reused more often than the 3D models they generate. The reuse of metamodels is amplified when the metamodels are created by designers with greater community experience. Metamodels make the community's design knowledge available for reuse for customization—or further extension of the metamodels, a kind of reuse for innovation.

    Title: A Probabilistic Disease Progression Model for Predicting Future Clinical Outcome,
    Abstract: In this work, we consider the problem of predicting the course of a progressive disease, such as cancer or Alzheimer's. Progressive diseases often start with mild symptoms that might precede a diagnosis, and each patient follows their own trajectory. Patient trajectories exhibit wild variability, which can be associated with many factors such as genotype, age, or sex. An additional layer of complexity is that, in real life, the amount and type of data available for each patient can differ significantly. For example, for one patient we might have no prior history, whereas for another patient we might have detailed clinical assessments obtained at multiple prior time-points. This paper presents a probabilistic model that can handle multiple modalities (including images and clinical assessments) and variable patient histories with irregular timings and missing entries, to predict clinical scores at future time-points. We use a sigmoidal function to model latent disease progression, which gives rise to clinical observations in our generative model. We implemented an approximate Bayesian inference strategy on the proposed model to estimate the parameters on data from a large population of subjects. Furthermore, the Bayesian framework enables the model to automatically fine-tune its predictions based on"

    Title: Feature Learning for Meta-Paths in Knowledge Graphs,
    Abstract: In this thesis, we study the problem of feature learning on heterogeneous
    knowledge graphs. These features can be used to perform tasks such as link
    prediction, classification and clustering on graphs. Knowledge graphs provide
    rich semantics encoded in the edge and node types. Meta-paths consist of these
    types and abstract paths in the graph. Until now, meta-paths can only be used
    as categorical features with high redundancy and are therefore unsuitable for
    machine learning models. We propose meta-path embeddings to solve this problem
    by learning semantical and compact vector representations of them. Current
    graph embedding methods only embed nodes and edge types and therefore miss
    semantics encoded in the combination of them. Our method embeds meta-paths
    using the skipgram model with an extension to deal with the redundancy and high
    amount of meta-paths in big knowledge graphs. We critically evaluate our
    embedding approach by predicting links on Wikidata. The experiments indicate
    that we learn a sensible embedding of the meta-paths but can improve it
    further.

    Title: The Complexity of Counting Surjective Homomorphisms and Compactions,
    Abstract: A homomorphism from a graph G to a graph H is a function from the vertices of
    G to the vertices of H that preserves edges. A homomorphism is surjective if it
    uses all of the vertices of H and it is a compaction if it uses all of the
    vertices of H and all of the non-loop edges of H. Hell and Nesetril gave a
    complete characterisation of the complexity of deciding whether there is a
    homomorphism from an input graph G to a fixed graph H. A complete
    characterisation is not known for surjective homomorphisms or for compactions,
    though there are many interesting results. Dyer and Greenhill gave a complete
    characterisation of the complexity of counting homomorphisms from an input
    graph G to a fixed graph H. In this paper, we give a complete characterisation
    of the complexity of counting surjective homomorphisms from an input graph G to
    a fixed graph H and we also give a complete characterisation of the complexity

Title: Bose-Hubbard lattice as a controllable environment for open quantum systems,
Abstract: We investigate the open dynamics of an atomic impurity embedded in a
one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard lattice. We derive the reduced evolution equation
for the impurity and show that the Bose-Hubbard lattice behaves as a tunable
engineered environment allowing to simulate both Markovian and non-Markovian
dynamics in a controlled and experimentally realisable way. We demonstrate that
the presence or absence of memory effects is a signature of the nature of the
excitations induced by the impurity, being delocalized or localized in the two
limiting cases of superfluid and Mott insulator, respectively. Furthermore, our
findings show how the excitations supported in the two phases can be
characterized as information carriers.

Title: Predicting the Effect of Temperature on Plant Growth Using Machine Learning,
Abstract: This study aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the effect of temperature on plant growth. The dataset includes various environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and light intensity, along with measurements of plant height and biomass. Different machine learning algorithms are compared to determine the most effective model for predicting plant growth under varying temperatures. The results show that a random forest algorithm outperforms other models in predicting plant growth. The study also explores the importance of different environmental factors in plant growth prediction."

    Title: A Regularized Framework for Sparse and Structured Neural Attention,
    Abstract: Modern neural networks are often augmented with an attention mechanism, which
    tells the network where to focus within the input. We propose in this paper a
    new framework for sparse and structured attention, building upon a smoothed max
    operator. We show that the gradient of this operator defines a mapping from
    real values to probabilities, suitable as an attention mechanism. Our framework
    includes softmax and a slight generalization of the recently-proposed sparsemax
    as special cases. However, we also show how our framework can incorporate
    modern structured penalties, resulting in more interpretable attention
    mechanisms, that focus on entire segments or groups of an input. We derive
    efficient algorithms to compute the forward and backward passes of our
    attention mechanisms, enabling their use in a neural network trained with
    backpropagation. To showcase their potential as a drop-in replacement for
    existing ones, we evaluate our attention mechanisms on three large-scale tasks:
    textual entailment, machine translation, and sentence summarization. Our
    attention mechanisms improve interpretability without sacrificing performance;
    notably, on textual entailment and summarization,"

    Title: Towards a More Reliable Privacy-preserving Recommender System,
    Abstract: This paper proposes a privacy-preserving distributed recommendation
    framework, Secure Distributed Collaborative Filtering (SDCF), to preserve the
    privacy of value, model and existence altogether. That says, not only the
    ratings from the users to the items, but also the existence of the ratings as
    well as the learned recommendation model are kept private in our framework. Our
    solution relies on a distributed client-server architecture and a two-stage
    Randomized Response algorithm, along with an implementation on the popular
    recommendation model, Matrix Factorization (MF). We further prove SDCF to meet
    the guarantee of Differential Privacy so that clients are allowed to specify
    arbitrary privacy levels. Experiments conducted on numerical rating prediction
    and one-class rating action prediction exhibit that SDCF does not sacrifice too
    much accuracy for privacy.

    Title: Using of heterogeneous corpora for training of an ASR system,
    Abstract: The paper summarizes the development of the LVCSR system built as a part of
    the Pashto speech-translation system at the SCALE (Summer Camp for Applied
    Language Exploration) 2015 workshop on ""Speech-to-text-translation for
    low-resource languages"". The Pashto language was chosen as a good ""proxy""
    low-resource language, exhibiting multiple phenomena which make the
    speech-recognition and speech-to-text-translation systems development hard.
    Even when the amount of data is seemingly sufficient, given the fact that the
    data originates from multiple sources, the preliminary experiments reveal that
    there is little to no benefit in merging (concatenating) the corpora and more
    elaborate ways of making use of all of the data must be worked out.
    This paper concentrates only on the LVCSR part and presents a range of
    different techniques that were found to be useful in order to benefit from
    multiple different corpora.

    Title: RCD: Rapid Close to Deadline Scheduling for Datacenter Networks,
    Abstract: Datacenter-based Cloud Computing services provide a flexible, scalable and yet economical infrastructure to host online services such as multimedia streaming, email and bulk storage. Many such services perform geo-replication to provide necessary quality of service and reliability to users resulting in frequent large inter-datacenter transfers. In order to meet tenant service level agreements (SLAs), these transfers have to be completed prior to a deadline. In addition, WAN resources are quite scarce and costly, meaning they should be fully utilized. Several recently proposed schemes, such as B4, TEMPUS, and SWAN have focused on improving the utilization of inter-datacenter transfers through centralized scheduling, however, they fail to provide a mechanism to guarantee that admitted requests meet their deadlines. Also, in a recent study, authors propose Amoeba, a system that allows tenants to define deadlines and guarantees that the specified deadlines are met, however, to admit new traffic, the proposed system has to modify the allocation of already admitted transfers. In this paper, we propose Rapid Close to Deadline Scheduling (RCD), a close to deadline traffic allocation technique that is fast and efficient. Through simulations, we show that R"

    Title: On the spectral geometry of manifolds with conic singularities,
    Abstract: In the previous article we derived a detailed asymptotic expansion of the heat trace for the Laplace-Beltrami operator on functions on manifolds with conic singularities. In this article we investigate how the terms in the expansion reflect the geometry of the manifold. Since the general expansion contains a logarithmic term, its vanishing is a necessary condition for smoothness of the manifold. In the two-dimensional case this implies that the constant term of the expansion contains a non-local term that determines the length of the (circular) cross section and vanishes precisely if this length equals \(2\pi\), that is, in the smooth case. We proceed to the study of higher dimensions. In the four-dimensional case, the logarithmic term in the expansion vanishes precisely when the cross section is a spherical space form, and we expect that the vanishing of a further singular term will imply again smoothness, but this is not yet clear beyond the case of cyclic space forms. In higher dimensions the situation is naturally more difficult. We illustrate this in the case of cross sections with constant curvature. Then the logarithmic term becomes a polynomial in"

    Title: Quantum Thermal Ensembles in Spinor Bose-Einstein Condensates,
    Abstract: We investigate the conditions under which a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) can serve as a thermal ensemble for the internal states of the atoms within it. By analyzing the statistical properties of the condensate, we show that under certain conditions, the BEC can effectively thermalize the internal states due to interactions and collisions among the atoms. This thermalization process is quantified using measures of entropy and coherence. The implications of this finding for quantum information processing and ultra-cold atomic physics are discussed.

    Title: Index Search Algorithms for Databases and Modern CPUs,
    Abstract: Over the years, many different indexing techniques and search algorithms have
    been proposed, including CSS-trees, CSB+ trees, k-ary binary search, and fast
    architecture sensitive tree search. There have also been papers on how best to
    set the many different parameters of these index structures, such as the node
    size of CSB+ trees.
    These indices have been proposed because CPU speeds have been increasing at a
    dramatically higher rate than memory speeds, giving rise to the Von Neumann
    CPU--Memory bottleneck. To hide the long latencies caused by memory access, it
    has become very important to well-utilize the features of modern CPUs. In order
    to drive down the average number of CPU clock cycles required to execute CPU
    instructions, and thus increase throughput, it has become important to achieve
    a good utilization of CPU resources. Some of these are the data and instruction
    caches, and the translation lookaside buffers. But it also has become important
    to avoid branch misprediction penalties, and utilize vectorization provided by
    CPUs in the form of SIMD instructions.

    Title: Rovibrational Optical Cooling of a Molecular Beam,
    Abstract: Cooling the rotation and the vibration of molecules by broadband light sources was possible for trapped molecular ions or ultracold molecules. Because of a low power spectral density, the cooling timescale has never fallen below a few milliseconds. Here we report on rotational and vibrational cooling of a supersonic beam of barium monofluoride molecules in less than 440 μs. Vibrational cooling was optimized by enhancing the spectral power density of a semiconductor light source at the underlying molecular transitions allowing us to transfer all the populations of v'=1-3 into the vibrational ground state (v'=0). Rotational cooling, that requires an efficient vibrational pumping, was then achieved. According to a Boltzmann fit, the rotation temperature was reduced by almost a factor of 10. In this fashion, the population of the lowest rotational levels increased by more than one order of magnitude.

    Title: Approximation Algorithms for Rectangle Packing Problems (PhD Thesis),
    Abstract: In rectangle packing problems we are given the task of placing axis-aligned
    rectangles in a given plane region, so that they do not overlap with each
    other. In Maximum Weight Independent Set of Rectangles (MWISR), their position
    is given and we can only select which rectangles to choose, while trying to
    maximize their total weight. In Strip Packing (SP), we have to pack all the
    given rectangles in a rectangular region of fixed width, while minimizing its
    height. In 2-Dimensional Geometric Knapsack (2DGK), the target region is a
    square of a given size, and our goal is to select and pack a subset of the
    given rectangles of maximum weight. We study a generalization of MWISR and use
    it to improve the approximation for a resource allocation problem called
    bagUFP. We revisit some classical results on SP and 2DGK, by proposing a
    framework based on smaller containers that are packed with simpler rules; while
    variations of this scheme are indeed a standard technique in this area, we
    abstract away some"

Title: Generalised Reichenbachian Common Cause Systems,
Abstract: The principle of the common cause claims that if an improbable coincidence has occurred, there must exist a common cause. This is generally taken to mean that positive correlations between non-causally related events should disappear when conditioning on the action of some underlying common cause. The extended interpretation of the principle, by contrast, urges that common causes should be called for in order to explain positive deviations between the estimated correlation of two events and the expected value of their correlation. The aim of this paper is to provide the extended reading of the principle with a general probabilistic model, capturing the simultaneous action of a system of multiple common causes. To this end, two distinct models are elaborated, and the necessary and sufficient conditions for their existence are determined.

    Title: A Unified Strouhal-Reynolds Number Relationship for Laminar Vortex Streets Generated by Different Shaped Obstacles,
    Abstract: A new Strouhal-Reynolds number relationship, \( St = \frac{1}{A + \frac{B}{Re}} \), has been recently proposed based on observations of laminar vortex shedding from circular cylinders in a flowing soap film. Since the new \( St \)-\( Re \) relation was derived from a general physical consideration, it raises the possibility that it may be applicable to vortex shedding from bodies other than circular ones. The work presented herein provides experimental evidence that this is the case. Our measurements also show that in the asymptotic limit (\( Re \rightarrow \infty \)), \( St_{\infty} = \frac{1}{A} \simeq 0.21 \) is constant independent of rod shapes, leaving \( B \) the only parameter that is shape dependent.

    Title: On convergence of the sample correlation matrices in high-dimensional data,
    Abstract: In this paper, we consider an estimation problem concerning the matrix of
    correlation coefficients in context of high dimensional data settings. In
    particular, we revisit some results in Li and Rolsalsky [Li, D. and Rolsalsky,
    A. (2006). Some strong limit theorems for the largest entries of sample
    correlation matrices, The Annals of Applied Probability, 16, 1, 423-447]. Four
    of the main theorems of Li and Rolsalsky (2006) are established in their full
    generalities and we simplify substantially some proofs of the quoted paper.
    Further, we generalize a theorem which is useful in deriving the existence of
    the pth moment as well as in studying the convergence rates in law of large
    numbers.

    Title: TrajectoryNet: An Embedded GPS Trajectory Representation for Point-based Classification Using Recurrent Neural Networks,
    Abstract: Understanding and discovering knowledge from GPS (Global Positioning System) traces of human activities is an essential topic in mobility-based urban computing. We propose TrajectoryNet—a neural network architecture for point-based trajectory classification to infer real world human transportation modes from GPS traces. To overcome the challenge of capturing the underlying latent factors in the low-dimensional and heterogeneous feature space imposed by GPS data, we develop a novel representation that embeds the original feature space into another space that can be understood as a form of basis expansion. We also enrich the feature space via segment-based information and use Maxout activations to improve the predictive power of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). We achieve over 98% classification accuracy when detecting four types of transportation modes, outperforming existing models without additional sensory data or location-based prior knowledge.

    Title: On the Diophantine equation $\sum_{j=1}^kjF_j^p=F_n^q$,
    Abstract: Let $F_n$ denote the $n^{th}$ term of the Fibonacci sequence. In this paper,
    we investigate the Diophantine equation $F_1^p+2F_2^p+\cdots+kF_{k}^p=F_{n}^q$
    in the positive integers $k$ and $n$, where $p$ and $q$ are given positive
    integers. A complete solution is given if the exponents are included in the set
    $\{1,2\}$. Based on the specific cases we could solve, and a computer search
    with $p,q,k\le100$ we conjecture that beside the trivial solutions only
    $F_8=F_1+2F_2+3F_3+4F_4$, $F_4^2=F_1+2F_2+3F_3$, and

    Title: Analysis-of-marginal-Tail-Means (ATM): a robust method for discrete black-box optimization,
    Abstract: We present a new method, called Analysis-of-marginal-Tail-Means (ATM), for effective robust optimization of discrete black-box problems. ATM has important applications to many real-world engineering problems (e.g., manufacturing optimization, product design, molecular engineering), where the objective to optimize is black-box and expensive, and the design space is inherently discrete. One weakness of existing methods is that they are not robust: these methods perform well under certain assumptions, but yield poor results when such assumptions (which are difficult to verify in black-box problems) are violated. ATM addresses this via the use of marginal tail means for optimization, which combines both rank-based and model-based methods. The trade-off between rank- and model-based optimization is tuned by first identifying important main effects and interactions, then finding a good compromise which best exploits additive structure. By adaptively tuning this trade-off from data, ATM provides improved robust optimization over existing methods, particularly in problems with (i) a large number of factors, (ii) unordered factors, or (iii) experimental noise. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ATM in"

Title: A Bayesian Estimation for the Fractional Order of the Differential Equation that Models Transport in Unconventional Hydrocarbon Reservoirs,
Abstract: The extraction of natural gas from the earth has been shown to be governed by
differential equations concerning flow through a porous material. Recently,
models such as fractional differential equations have been developed to model
this phenomenon. One key issue with these models is estimating the fraction of
the differential equation. Traditional methods such as maximum likelihood,
least squares and even method of moments are not available to estimate this
parameter as traditional calculus methods do not apply. We develop a Bayesian
approach to estimate the fraction of the order of the differential equation
that models transport in unconventional hydrocarbon reservoirs. In this paper,
we use this approach to adequately quantify the uncertainties associated with
the error and predictions. A simulation study is presented as well to assess
the utility of the modeling approach.

Title: Methods for Estimation of Convex Sets,
Abstract: In the framework of shape constrained estimation, we review methods and works
done in convex set estimation. These methods mostly build on stochastic and
convex geometry, empirical process theory, functional analysis, linear
programming, extreme value theory, etc. The statistical problems that we review
include density support estimation, estimation of the level sets of densities
or depth functions, nonparametric regression, etc. We focus on the estimation
of convex sets under the Nikodym and Hausdorff metrics, which require different
techniques and, quite surprisingly, lead to very different results, in
particular in density support estimation. Finally, we discuss computational
issues in high dimensions.

    Title: Global solutions to reaction-diffusion equations with super-linear drift and multiplicative noise,

    boundary conditions and suitable initial data, in the case that there exists
    $\varepsilon>0$ such that $\vert b(z)\vert \ge|z|(\log|z|)^{1+\varepsilon}$ for
    all sufficiently-large values of $|z|$. When $\sigma\equiv 0$, it is well known
    that such PDEs frequently have non-trivial stationary solutions. By contrast,

    Title: Show, Attend and Interact: Perceivable Human-Robot Social Interaction through Neural Attention Q-Network,
    Abstract: For a safe, natural and effective human-robot social interaction, it is essential to develop a system that allows a robot to demonstrate the perceivable responsive behaviors to complex human behaviors. We introduce the Multimodal Deep Attention Recurrent Q-Network using which the robot exhibits human-like social interaction skills after 14 days of interacting with people in an uncontrolled real world. Each and every day during the 14 days, the system gathered robot interaction experiences with people through a hit-and-trial method and then trained the MDARQN on these experiences using end-to-end reinforcement learning approach. The results of interaction based learning indicate that the robot has learned to respond to complex human behaviors in a perceivable and socially acceptable manner.

    Title: Improving Community Detection by Mining Social Interactions,
    Abstract: Social relationships can be divided into different classes based on the regularity with which they occur and the similarity among them. Thus, rare and somewhat similar relationships are random and cause noise in a social network, thus hiding the actual structure of the network and preventing an accurate analysis of it. In this context, in this paper we propose a process to handle social network data that exploits temporal features to improve the detection of communities by existing algorithms. By removing random interactions, we observe that social networks converge to a topology with more purely social relationships and more modular communities.

    Title: X-ray spectral properties of seven heavily obscured Seyfert 2 galaxies,
    Abstract: We present the combined Chandra and Swift-BAT spectral analysis of seven Seyfert 2 galaxies selected from the Swift-BAT 100-month catalog. We selected nearby (z<=0.03) sources lacking of a ROSAT counterpart and never previously observed with Chandra in the 0.3-10 keV energy range, and targeted these objects with 10 ks Chandra ACIS-S observations. The X-ray spectral fitting over the 0.3-150 keV energy range allows us to determine that all the objects are significantly obscured, having NH>=1E23 cm^(-2) at a >99% confidence level. Moreover, one to three sources are candidate Compton thick Active Galactic Nuclei (CT-AGN), i.e., have NH>=1E24 cm^(-2). We also test the recent ""spectral curvature"" method developed by Koss et al. (2016) to find candidate CT-AGN, finding a good agreement between our results and their predictions. Since the selection criteria we adopted have been effective in"

    Title: On the role of synaptic stochasticity in training low-precision neural networks,
    Abstract: Stochasticity and limited precision of synaptic weights in neural network
    models are key aspects of both biological and hardware modeling of learning
    processes. Here we show that a neural network model with stochastic binary
    weights naturally gives prominence to exponentially rare dense regions of
    solutions with a number of desirable properties such as robustness and good
    generalization performance, while typical solutions are isolated and hard to
    find. Binary solutions of the standard perceptron problem are obtained from a
    simple gradient descent procedure on a set of real values parametrizing a
    probability distribution over the binary synapses. Both analytical and
    numerical results are presented. An algorithmic extension aimed at training
    discrete deep neural networks is also investigated.

    Abstract: The dynamics of a quantum vortex torus knot ${\cal T}_{P,Q}$ and similar
knots in an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate at zero temperature in the
Thomas-Fermi regime has been considered in the hydrodynamic approximation. The
condensate has a spatially nonuniform equilibrium density profile $\rho(z,r)$
due to an external axisymmetric potential. It is assumed that $z_*=0$, $r_*=1$
is a maximum point for function $r\rho(z,r)$, with $\delta
(r\rho)\approx-(\alpha-\epsilon) z^2/2 -(\alpha+\epsilon) (\delta r)^2/2$ at
small $z$ and $\delta r$. Configuration of knot in the cylindrical coordinates
is specified by a complex $2\pi P$-periodic function
$A(\varphi,t)=Z(\varphi,t)+i [R(\varphi,t)-1]$. In the case $|A|\ll 1$ the
system is described by relatively simple approximate equations for re-scaled"

    Abstract: Interfacing a ferromagnet with a polarized ferroelectric gate generates a
    non-uniform, interfacial spin density coupled to the ferroelectric polarization
    allowing so for an electric field control of effective transversal field to
    magnetization. Here we study the dynamic magnetization switching behavior of
    such a multilayer system based on the Landau-Lifshitz-Baryakhtar equation,
    demonstrating that interfacial magnetoelectric coupling is utilizable as a
    highly localized and efficient tool for manipulating magnetism.

Title: Divide and Conquer: Variable Set Separation in Hybrid Systems Reachability Analysis,
Abstract: In this paper we propose an improvement for flowpipe-construction-based
reachability analysis techniques for hybrid systems. Such methods apply
iterative successor computations to pave the reachable region of the state
space by state sets in an over-approximative manner. As the computational costs
steeply increase with the dimension, in this work we analyse the possibilities
for improving scalability by dividing the search space in sub-spaces and
execute reachability computations in the sub-spaces instead of the global
space. We formalise such an algorithm and provide experimental evaluations to
compare the efficiency as well as the precision of our sub-space search to the
original search in the global space.

Title: Dimensionality-strain phase diagram of strontium iridates,
Abstract: The competition between spin-orbit coupling, bandwidth ($W$) and
electron-electron interaction ($U$) makes iridates highly susceptible to small
external perturbations, which can trigger the onset of novel types of
electronic and magnetic states. Here we employ {\em first principles}
calculations based on density functional theory and on the constrained random
phase approximation to study how dimensionality and strain affect the strength
of $U$ and $W$ in (SrIrO$_3$)$_m$/(SrTiO$_3$) superlattices. The result is a
phase diagram explaining two different types of controllable magnetic and
electronic transitions, spin-flop and insulator-to-metal, connected with the
disruption of the $J_{eff}=1/2$ state which cannnot be understood within a
simplified local picture.

    Title: The First Optical Spectra of Wolf Rayet Stars in M101 Revealed with Gemini/GMOS,
    Abstract: Deep narrow-band HST imaging of the iconic spiral galaxy M101 has revealed
    over a thousand new Wolf Rayet (WR) candidates. We report spectrographic
    confirmation of 10 HeII emission line sources hosting 15 WR stars. We find WR
    stars present at both sub- and super-solar metalicities with WC stars favouring
    more metal-rich regions compared to WN stars. We investigate the association of
    WR stars with HII regions using archival HST imaging and conclude that the
    majority of WR stars are in or associated with HII regions. Of the 10 emission
    lines sources, only one appears to be unassociated with a star-forming region.
    Our spectroscopic survey provides confidence that our narrow-band photometric
    candidates are in fact bonafide WR stars, which will allow us to characterise
    the progenitors of any core-collapse supernovae that erupt in the future in
    M101.

    Title: Bayesian Nonparametric Spectral Estimation,
    Abstract: Spectral estimation (SE) aims to identify how the energy of a signal (e.g., a
    time series) is distributed across different frequencies. This can become
    particularly challenging when only partial and noisy observations of the signal
    are available, where current methods fail to handle uncertainty appropriately.
    In this context, we propose a joint probabilistic model for signals,
    observations and spectra, where SE is addressed as an exact inference problem.
    Assuming a Gaussian process prior over the signal, we apply Bayes' rule to find
    the analytic posterior distribution of the spectrum given a set of
    observations. Besides its expressiveness and natural account of spectral
    uncertainty, the proposed model also provides a functional-form representation
    of the power spectral density, which can be optimised efficiently. Comparison
    with previous approaches, in particular against Lomb-Scargle, is addressed
    theoretically and also experimentally in three different scenarios. Code and
    demo available at this https URL.

Title: A Hand Combining Two Simple Grippers to Pick up and Arrange Objects for Assembly,
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel robotic hand design for assembly tasks. The idea
is to combine two simple grippers -- an inner gripper which is used for precise
alignment, and an outer gripper which is used for stable holding. Conventional
robotic hands require complicated compliant mechanisms or complicated control
strategy and force sensing to conduct assemble tasks, which makes them costly
and difficult to pick and arrange small objects like screws or washers.
Compared to the conventional hands, the proposed design provides a low-cost
solution for aligning, picking up, and arranging various objects by taking
advantages of the geometric constraints of the positioning fingers and gravity.
It is able to deal with small screws and washers, and eliminate the position
errors of cylindrical objects or objects with cylindrical holes. In the
experiments, both real-world tasks and quantitative analysis are performed to
validate the aligning, picking, and arrangements abilities of the design.

    Title: Second sound in systems of one-dimensional fermions,
    Abstract: We study sound in Galilean invariant systems of one-dimensional fermions. At
    low temperatures, we find a broad range of frequencies in which in addition to
    the waves of density there is a second sound corresponding to ballistic
    propagation of heat in the system. The damping of the second sound mode is
    weak, provided the frequency is large compared to a relaxation rate that is
    exponentially small at low temperatures. At lower frequencies the second sound
    mode is damped, and the propagation of heat is diffusive.

    Title: Forecasting Across Time Series Databases using Recurrent Neural Networks on Groups of Similar Series: A Clustering Approach,
Abstract: With the advent of Big Data, nowadays in many applications databases
containing large quantities of similar time series are available. Forecasting
time series in these domains with traditional univariate forecasting procedures
leaves great potentials for producing accurate forecasts untapped. Recurrent
neural networks (RNNs), and in particular Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
networks, have proven recently that they are able to outperform
state-of-the-art univariate time series forecasting methods in this context
when trained across all available time series. However, if the time series
database is heterogeneous, accuracy may degenerate, so that on the way towards
fully automatic forecasting methods in this space, a notion of similarity
between the time series needs to be built into the methods. To this end, we
present a prediction model that can be used with different types of RNN models
on subgroups of similar time series, which are identified by time series
clustering techniques. We assess our proposed methodology using LSTM networks,
a widely popular RNN variant. Our method achieves competitive results on

    Title: Quantum Annealing for the Traveling Salesman Problem,
    Abstract: We present a method for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem using quantum annealing. The problem is formulated as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem, which can be directly mapped to the hardware of a D-Wave quantum annealer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing the solutions obtained with the quantum annealer to those found by classical algorithms on a set of benchmark instances. Our results show that quantum annealing can provide competitive performance for certain classes of instances, particularly those with a large number of cities."

    Title: Hybrid CTC-Attention based End-to-End Speech Recognition using Subword Units,
    Abstract: In this paper, we present an end-to-end automatic speech recognition system,
    which successfully employs subword units in a hybrid CTC-Attention based
    system. The subword units are obtained by the byte-pair encoding (BPE)
    compression algorithm. Compared to using words as modeling units, using
    characters or subword units does not suffer from the out-of-vocabulary (OOV)
    problem. Furthermore, using subword units further offers a capability in
    modeling longer context than using characters. We evaluate different systems
    over the LibriSpeech 1000h dataset. The subword-based hybrid CTC-Attention
    system obtains 6.8% word error rate (WER) on the test_clean subset without any
    dictionary or external language model. This represents a significant
    improvement (a 12.8% WER relative reduction) over the character-based hybrid
    CTC-Attention system."

    Title: Ranks of rational points of the Jacobian varieties of hyperelliptic curves,
    Abstract: In this paper, we obtain bounds for the Mordell-Weil ranks over cyclotomic
    extensions of a wide range of abelian varieties defined over a number field \( F \)
    whose primes above \( p \) are totally ramified over \( F/\mathbb{Q} \). We assume that
    the abelian varieties may have good non-ordinary reduction at those primes. Our
    work is a generalization of \cite{Kim}, in which the second author generalized
    Perrin-Riou's Iwasawa theory for elliptic curves over \( \mathbb{Q} \) with
    supersingular reduction (\cite{Perrin-Riou}) to elliptic curves defined over
    the above-mentioned number field \( F \). On top of non-ordinary reduction and the
    ramification of the field \( F \), we deal with the additional difficulty that the
    dimensions of the abelian varieties can be any number bigger than 1 which
    causes a variety of issues. As a result, we obtain bounds for the ranks over

Title: Identification of a space varying coefficient of a linear viscoelastic string of Maxwell-Boltzmann type,
Abstract: In this paper we solve the problem of the identification of a coefficient
which appears in the model of a distributed system with persistent memory
encountered in linear viscoelasticity (and in diffusion processes with memory).
The additional data used in the identification are subsumed in the input output
map from the deformation to the traction on the boundary. We extend a dynamical
approach to identification introduced by Belishev in the case of purely elastic
(memoryless) bodies and based on a special equation due to Blagoveshchenskii.
So, in particular, we extend Blagoveshchenskii equation to our class of systems
with persistent memory.

Title: Towards Evolutional Compression,
Abstract: Compressing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is essential for
transferring the success of CNNs to a wide variety of applications to mobile
devices. In contrast to directly recognizing subtle weights or filters as
redundant in a given CNN, this paper presents an evolutionary method to
automatically eliminate redundant convolution filters. We represent each
compressed network as a binary individual of specific fitness. Then, the
population is upgraded at each evolutionary iteration using genetic operations.
As a result, an extremely compact CNN is generated using the fittest
individual. In this approach, either large or small convolution filters can be
redundant, and filters in the compressed network are more distinct. In
addition, since the number of filters in each convolutional layer is reduced,
the number of filter channels and the size of feature maps are also decreased,
naturally improving both the compression and speed-up ratios. Experiments on
benchmark deep CNN models suggest the superiority of the proposed algorithm
over the state-of-the-art compression methods.

allied fields. However, the robustness of such neural networks is seldom
apprised, especially after high classification accuracy has been attained. In
this paper, we evaluate the robustness of three recurrent neural networks to
tiny perturbations, on three widely used datasets, to argue that high accuracy
does not always mean a stable and a robust (to bounded perturbations,
adversarial attacks, etc.) system. Especially, normalizing the spectrum of the
discrete recurrent network to bound the spectrum (using power method, Rayleigh
quotient, etc.) on a unit disk produces stable, albeit highly non-robust neural
networks. Furthermore, using the $\epsilon$-pseudo-spectrum, we show that
training of recurrent networks, say using gradient-based methods, often result
in non-normal matrices that may or may not be diagonalizable. Therefore, the
open problem lies in constructing methods that optimize not only for accuracy
but also for the stability and the robustness of the underlying neural network,
a criterion that is distinct from the other."

    Title: Understanding looping kinetics of a long polymer molecule in solution. Exact solution for delocalized sink model,
    Abstract: The fundamental understanding of loop formation of long polymer chains in
    solution has been an important thread of research for several theoretical and
    experimental studies. Loop formations are important phenomenological parameters
    in many important biological processes. Here we give a general method for
    finding an exact analytical solution for the occurrence of looping of a long
    polymer chains in solution modeled by using a Smoluchowski-like equation with a
    delocalized sink. The average rate constant for the delocalized sink is
    explicitly expressed in terms of the corresponding rate constants for localized
    sinks with different initial conditions. Simple analytical expressions are
    provided for average rate constant.

    Title: A Nonparametric Method for Producing Isolines of Bivariate Exceedance Probabilities,
    Abstract: We present a method for drawing isolines indicating regions of equal joint
    exceedance probability for bivariate data. The method relies on bivariate
    regular variation, a dependence framework widely used for extremes. This
    framework enables drawing isolines corresponding to very low exceedance
    probabilities and these lines may lie beyond the range of the data. The method
    we utilize for characterizing dependence in the tail is largely nonparametric.
    Furthermore, we extend this method to the case of asymptotic independence and
    propose a procedure which smooths the transition from asymptotic independence
    in the interior to the first-order behavior on the axes. We propose a
    diagnostic plot for assessing isoline estimate and choice of smoothing, and a
    bootstrap procedure to visually assess uncertainty.

    Title: Cascaded Coded Distributed Computing on Heterogeneous Networks,
    Abstract: Coded distributed computing (CDC) introduced by Li et al. in 2015 offers an
    efficient approach to trade computing power to reduce the communication load in
    general distributed computing frameworks such as MapReduce. For the more
    general cascaded CDC, Map computations are repeated at \( r \) nodes to
    significantly reduce the communication load among nodes tasked with computing
    \( Q \) Reduce functions \( s \) times. While an achievable cascaded CDC scheme was
    proposed, it only operates on homogeneous networks, where the storage,
    computation load and communication load of each computing node is the same. In
    this paper, we address this limitation by proposing a novel combinatorial
    design which operates on heterogeneous networks where nodes have varying
    storage and computing capabilities. We provide an analytical characterization
    of the computation-communication trade-off and show that it is optimal within a
    constant factor and could outperform the state-of-the-art homogeneous schemes.

    Title: Shape Generation using Spatially Partitioned Point Clouds,
    Abstract: We propose a method to generate 3D shapes using point clouds. Given a
    point-cloud representation of a 3D shape, our method builds a kd-tree to
    spatially partition the points. This orders them consistently across all
    shapes, resulting in reasonably good correspondences across all shapes. We then
    use PCA analysis to derive a linear shape basis across the spatially
    partitioned points, and optimize the point ordering by iteratively minimizing
    the PCA reconstruction error. Even with the spatial sorting, the point clouds
    are inherently noisy and the resulting distribution over the shape coefficients
    can be highly multi-modal. We propose to use the expressive power of neural
    networks to learn a distribution over the shape coefficients in a
    generative-adversarial framework. Compared to 3D shape generative models
    trained on voxel-representations, our point-based method is considerably more
    light-weight and scalable, with little loss of quality. It also outperforms
    simpler linear factor models such as Probabilistic PCA, both qualitatively and
    quantitatively, on a number"

    Title: An Agile Software Engineering Method to Design Blockchain Applications,
    Abstract: Cryptocurrencies and their foundation technology, the Blockchain, are reshaping finance and economics, allowing a decentralized approach enabling trusted applications with no trusted counterpart. More recently, the Blockchain and the programs running on it, called Smart Contracts, are also finding more and more applications in all fields requiring trust and sound certifications. Some people have come to the point of saying that the ""Blockchain revolution"" can be compared to that of the Internet and the Web in their early days. As a result, all the software development revolving around the Blockchain technology is growing at a staggering rate. The feeling of many software engineers about such huge interest in Blockchain technologies is that of unruled and hurried software development, a sort of competition on a first-come-first-served basis which does not assure neither software quality, nor that the basic concepts of software engineering are taken into account. This paper tries to cope with this issue, proposing a software development process to gather the requirement, analyze, design, develop, test and deploy Blockchain applications. The process is based on several Agile practices, such as User Stories and iterative and incremental development based on them. However, it makes also use of more formal not"

Title: A systematic analysis of the XMM-Newton background: III. Impact of the magnetospheric environment,
Abstract: A detailed characterization of the particle induced background is fundamental
for many of the scientific objectives of the Athena X-ray telescope, thus an
adequate knowledge of the background that will be encountered by Athena is
desirable. Current X-ray telescopes have shown that the intensity of the
particle induced background can be highly variable. Different regions of the
magnetosphere can have very different environmental conditions, which can, in
principle, differently affect the particle induced background detected by the
instruments. We present results concerning the influence of the magnetospheric
environment on the background detected by EPIC instrument onboard XMM-Newton
through the estimate of the variation of the in-Field-of-View background excess
along the XMM-Newton orbit. An important contribution to the XMM background,
which may affect the Athena background as well, comes from soft proton flares.
Along with the flaring component a low-intensity component is also present. We
find that both show modest variations in the different magnetozones and that
the soft proton component shows a strong trend with the distance from Earth.

    Title: Adaptive Similar Triangles Method: a Stable Alternative to Sinkhorn's Algorithm for Regularized Optimal Transport,

    Abstract: In this paper, we are motivated by two important applications: entropy-regularized optimal transport problem and road or IP traffic demand matrix estimation by entropy model. Both of them include solving a special type of optimization problem with linear equality constraints and objective given as a sum of an entropy regularizer and a linear function. It is known that the state-of-the-art solvers for this problem, which are based on Sinkhorn's method (also known as RSA or balancing method), can fail to work, when the entropy-regularization parameter is small. We consider the above optimization problem as a particular instance of a general strongly convex optimization problem with linear constraints. We propose a new algorithm to solve this general class of problems. Our approach is based on the transition to the dual problem. First, we introduce a new accelerated gradient method with adaptive choice of gradient's Lipschitz constant. Then, we apply this method to the dual problem and show, how to reconstruct an approximate solution to the primal problem with provable convergence rate. We prove the rate \( O(1/k^2) \), \( k \) being"

    Title: A Decidable Very Expressive Description Logic for Databases (Extended Version),
    Abstract: We introduce $\mathcal{DLR}^+$, an extension of the n-ary propositionally
    closed description logic $\mathcal{DLR}$ to deal with attribute-labelled tuples
    (generalising the positional notation), projections of relations, and global
    and local objectification of relations, able to express inclusion, functional,
    key, and external uniqueness dependencies. The logic is equipped with both TBox
    and ABox axioms. We show how a simple syntactic restriction on the appearance
    of projections sharing common attributes in a $\mathcal{DLR}^+$ knowledge base
    makes reasoning in the language decidable with the same computational
    complexity as $\mathcal{DLR}$. The obtained $\mathcal{DLR}^\pm$ n-ary
    description logic is able to encode more thoroughly conceptual data models such
    as EER, UML, and ORM.

Title: Structural and bonding character of potassium-doped p-terphenyl superconductors,
Abstract: Recently, there is a series of reports by Wang et al. on the superconductivity in K-doped p-terphenyl (KxC18H14) with the transition temperatures range from 7 to 123 Kelvin. Identifying the structural and bonding character is the key to understand the superconducting phases and the related properties. Therefore we carried out an extensive study on the crystal structures with different doping levels and investigate the thermodynamic stability, structural, electronic, and magnetic properties by the first-principles calculations. Our calculated structures capture most features of the experimentally observed X-ray diffraction patterns. The K doping concentration is constrained to within the range of 2 and 3. The obtained formation energy indicates that the system at x = 2.5 is more stable. The strong ionic bonding interaction is found in between K atoms and organic molecules. The charge transfer accounts for the metallic feature of the doped materials. For a small amount of charge transferred, the tilting force between the two successive benzenes drives the system to stabilize at the antiferromagnetic ground state, while the system"

    Title: Around Average Behavior: 3-lambda Network Model,
    Abstract: The analysis of networks affects the research of many real phenomena. The
    complex network structure can be viewed as a network's state at the time of the
    analysis or as a result of the process through which the network arises.
    Research activities focus on both and, thanks to them, we know not only many
    measurable properties of networks but also the essence of some phenomena that
    occur during the evolution of networks. One typical research area is the
    analysis of co-authorship networks and their evolution. In our paper, the
    analysis of one real-world co-authorship network and inspiration from existing
    models form the basis of the hypothesis from which we derive new 3-lambda
    network model. This hypothesis works with the assumption that regular behavior
    of nodes revolves around an average. However, some anomalies may occur. The
    3-lambda model is stochastic and uses the three parameters associated with the
    average behavior of the nodes. The growth of the network based on this model
    assumes that one step of the growth is an interaction in which both new and
    existing nodes are participating. In"

Title: 4-DoF Tracking for Robot Fine Manipulation Tasks,
Abstract: This paper presents two visual trackers from the different paradigms of
learning and registration based tracking and evaluates their application in
image based visual servoing. They can track object motion with four degrees of
freedom (DoF) which, as we will show here, is sufficient for many fine
manipulation tasks. One of these trackers is a newly developed learning based
tracker that relies on learning discriminative correlation filters while the
other is a refinement of a recent 8 DoF RANSAC based tracker adapted with a new
appearance model for tracking 4 DoF motion.
Both trackers are shown to provide superior performance to several state of
the art trackers on an existing dataset for manipulation tasks. Further, a new
dataset with challenging sequences for fine manipulation tasks captured from
robot mounted eye-in-hand (EIH) cameras is also presented. These sequences have
a variety of challenges encountered during real tasks including jittery camera
movement, motion blur, drastic scale changes and partial occlusions.
Quantitative and qualitative results on these sequences are used to show that
these two trackers are robust to failures while providing high precision that
makes them"

    Title: Non-convex Finite-Sum Optimization Via SCSG Methods,
    Abstract: We develop a class of algorithms, as variants of the stochastically
    controlled stochastic gradient (SCSG) methods (Lei and Jordan, 2016), for the
    smooth non-convex finite-sum optimization problem. Assuming the smoothness of
    each component, the complexity of SCSG to reach a stationary point with
    $\mathbb{E} \|\nabla f(x)\|^{2}\le \epsilon$ is $O\left (\min\{\epsilon^{-5/3},
    \epsilon^{-1}n^{2/3}\}\right)$, which strictly outperforms the stochastic
    gradient descent. Moreover, SCSG is never worse than the state-of-the-art
    methods based on variance reduction and it significantly outperforms them when
    the target accuracy is low. A similar acceleration is also achieved when the
    functions satisfy the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition. Empirical experiments
    demonstrate that SCSG outperforms stochastic gradient methods on training
    multi-layers neural networks in terms of both training and validation loss"

    Title: BinPro: A Tool for Binary Source Code Provenance,
    Abstract: Enforcing open source licenses such as the GNU General Public License (GPL),
    analyzing a binary for possible vulnerabilities, and code maintenance are all
    situations where it is useful to be able to determine the source code
    provenance of a binary. While previous work has either focused on computing
    binary-to-binary similarity or source-to-source similarity, BinPro is the first
    work we are aware of to tackle the problem of source-to-binary similarity.
    BinPro can match binaries with their source code even without knowing which
    compiler was used to produce the binary, or what optimization level was used
    with the compiler. To do this, BinPro utilizes machine learning to compute
    optimal code features for determining binary-to-source similarity and a static
    analysis pipeline to extract and compute similarity based on those features.
    Our experiments show that on average BinPro computes a similarity of 81% for
    matching binaries and source code of the same applications, and an average
    similarity of 25% for binaries and source code of similar but different
    applications. This shows that BinPro's similarity score is"

    Title: Viscous dissipation of surface waves and its relevance to analogue gravity experiments,
    Abstract: We consider dissipation of surface waves on fluids, with a view to its effects on analogue gravity experiments. We begin by reviewing some general properties of wave dissipation, before restricting our attention to surface waves and the dissipative role played by viscosity there. Finally, with particular focus on water, we consider several experimental setups inspired by analogue gravity: the analogue Hawking effect, the black hole laser, the analogue wormhole, and double bouncing at the wormhole entrance. Dissipative effects are considered in each, and we give estimates for their optimized experimental parameters.

Title: Identifying Similarities in Epileptic Patients for Drug Resistance Prediction,
Abstract: Currently, approximately 30% of epileptic patients treated with antiepileptic
drugs (AEDs) remain resistant to treatment (known as refractory patients). This
project seeks to understand the underlying similarities in refractory patients
vs. other epileptic patients, identify features contributing to drug resistance
across underlying phenotypes for refractory patients, and develop predictive
models for drug resistance in epileptic patients. In this study, epileptic
patient data was examined to attempt to observe discernable similarities or
differences in refractory patients (case) and other non-refractory patients
(control) to map underlying mechanisms in causality. For the first part of the
study, unsupervised algorithms such as Kmeans, Spectral Clustering, and
Gaussian Mixture Models were used to examine patient features projected into a
lower dimensional space. Results from this study showed a high degree of
non-linearity in the underlying feature space. For the second part of this
study, classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosted
Decision Trees, and SVMs, were tested on the reduced-dimensionality"

    Title: The Mixing method: low-rank coordinate descent for semidefinite programming with diagonal constraints,
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a low-rank coordinate descent approach to
structured semidefinite programming with diagonal constraints. The approach,
which we call the Mixing method, is extremely simple to implement, has no free
parameters, and typically attains an order of magnitude or better improvement
in optimization performance over the current state of the art. We show that the
method is strictly decreasing, converges to a critical point, and further that
for sufficient rank all non-optimal critical points are unstable. Moreover, we
prove that with a step size, the Mixing method converges to the global optimum
of the semidefinite program almost surely in a locally linear rate under random
initialization. This is the first low-rank semidefinite programming method that
has been shown to achieve a global optimum on the spherical manifold without
assumption. We apply our algorithm to two related domains: solving the maximum
cut semidefinite relaxation, and solving a maximum satisfiability relaxation
(we also briefly consider additional applications such as learning word
embeddings). In all settings, we demonstrate substantial improvement over the
existing"

    Title: Adaptive Multi-Step Prediction based EKF to Power System Dynamic State Estimation,
    Abstract: Power system dynamic state estimation is essential to monitoring and
    controlling power system stability. Kalman filtering approaches are predominant
    in estimation of synchronous machine dynamic states (i.e. rotor angle and rotor
    speed). This paper proposes an adaptive multi-step prediction (AMSP) approach
    to improve the extended Kalman filter s (EKF) performance in estimating the
    dynamic states of a synchronous machine. The proposed approach consists of
    three major steps. First, two indexes are defined to quantify the non-linearity
    levels of the state transition function and measurement function, respectively.
    Second, based on the non-linearity indexes, a multi prediction factor (Mp) is
    defined to determine the number of prediction steps. And finally, to mitigate
    the non-linearity impact on dynamic state estimation (DSE) accuracy, the
    prediction step repeats a few time before performing the correction step. The
    two-area four-machine system is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the
    proposed AMSP approach. It is shown through the Monte-Carlo method that"

    Title: Efficient Correlated Topic Modeling with Topic Embedding,
    Abstract: Correlated topic modeling has been limited to small model and problem sizes
    due to their high computational cost and poor scaling. In this paper, we
    propose a new model which learns compact topic embeddings and captures topic
    correlations through the closeness between the topic vectors. Our method
    enables efficient inference in the low-dimensional embedding space, reducing
    previous cubic or quadratic time complexity to linear w.r.t the topic size. We
    further speedup variational inference with a fast sampler to exploit sparsity
    of topic occurrence. Extensive experiments show that our approach is capable of
    handling model and data scales which are several orders of magnitude larger
    than existing correlation results, without sacrificing modeling quality by
    providing competitive or superior performance in document classification and
    retrieval."

    Title: A criterion related to the Riemann Hypothesis,
    Abstract: A crucial role in the Nyman-Beurling-Báez-Duarte approach to the Riemann
    Hypothesis is played by the distance \[
    d_N^2:=\inf_{A_N}\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^\infty\left|1-\zeta
    A_N\left(\frac{1}{2}+it\right)\right|^2\frac{dt}{\frac{1}{4}+t^2}\:, \] where
    the infimum is over all Dirichlet polynomials
    $$A_N(s)=\sum_{n=1}^{N}\frac{a_n}{n^s}$$ of length $N$. In this paper we
    investigate $d_N^2$ under the assumption that the Riemann zeta function has
    four non-trivial zeros off the critical line. Thus we obtain a criterion for
    the non validity of the Riemann Hypothesis.

    Title: Optimal Input Design for Affine Model Discrimination with Applications in Intention-Aware Vehicles,
    Abstract: This paper considers the optimal design of input signals for the purpose of
    discriminating among a finite number of affine models with uncontrolled inputs
    and noise. Each affine model represents a different system operating mode,
    corresponding to unobserved intents of other drivers or robots, or to fault
    types or attack strategies, etc. The input design problem aims to find optimal
    separating/discriminating (controlled) inputs such that the output trajectories
    of all the affine models are guaranteed to be distinguishable from each other,
    despite uncertainty in the initial condition and uncontrolled inputs as well as
    the presence of process and measurement noise. We propose a novel formulation
    to solve this problem, with an emphasis on guarantees for model discrimination
    and optimality, in contrast to a previously proposed conservative formulation
    using robust optimization. This new formulation can be recast as a bilevel
    optimization problem and further reformulated as a mixed-integer linear program
    (MILP). Moreover, our fairly general problem setting allows the incorporation
    of objectives and/or responsibilities among rational agents"

Title: Predicting the Impact of Climate Change on Agricultural Productivity Using Machine Learning,
Abstract: This study investigates the use of machine learning algorithms to predict the impact of climate change on agricultural productivity. The authors collected data on temperature, precipitation, and soil moisture from multiple weather stations across different regions. They then applied various machine learning models, including random forests and support vector machines, to forecast changes in crop yields under different climate scenarios. The results suggest that certain regions may experience significant declines in productivity due to increased temperatures and altered rainfall patterns. The study highlights the potential of machine learning to aid in adaptive agricultural management strategies."

    Abstract: This paper provides an introduction to the theory of quantum entanglement, a phenomenon where quantum particles become interconnected and the state of one particle cannot be described independently of the state of the others, even when the particles are separated by large distances. The paper covers the basic concepts of quantum mechanics necessary to understand entanglement, including superposition and measurement. It also discusses the mathematical formalism of entanglement, focusing on density matrices and the Schmidt decomposition. Additionally, the paper explores the implications of entanglement for quantum information processing, such as quantum teleportation and quantum cryptography."

    Title: The connection between zero chromaticity and long in-plane polarization lifetime in a magnetic storage ring,
    Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate the connection between a magnetic storage ring
    with additional sextupole fields set so that the x and y chromaticities vanish
    and the maximizing of the lifetime of in-plane polarization (IPP) for a
    0.97-GeV/c deuteron beam. The IPP magnitude was measured by continuously
    monitoring the down-up scattering asymmetry (sensitive to sideways
    polarization) in an in-beam, carbon-target polarimeter and unfolding the
    precession of the IPP due to the magnetic anomaly of the deuteron. The optimum
    operating conditions for a long IPP lifetime were made by scanning the field of
    the storage ring sextupole magnet families while observing the rate of IPP loss
    during storage of the beam. The beam was bunched and electron cooled. The IPP
    losses appear to arise from the change of the orbit circumference, and
    consequently the particle speed and spin tune, due to the transverse betatron
    oscillations of individual particles in the beam. The effects of these changes
    are canceled by"

    Abstract: We formulate a correspondence between affine and projective special Kähler
    manifolds of the same dimension. As an application, we show that, under this
    correspondence, the affine special Kähler manifolds in the image of the rigid
    r-map are mapped to one-parameter deformations of projective special Kähler
    manifolds in the image of the supergravity r-map. The above one-parameter
    deformations are interpreted as perturbative $\alpha'$-corrections in heterotic
    and type-II string compactifications with $N=2$ supersymmetry. Also affine
    special Kähler manifolds with quadratic prepotential are mapped to
    one-parameter families of projective special Kähler manifolds with quadratic
    prepotential. We show that the completeness of the deformed supergravity r-map
    metric depends solely on the (well-understood) completeness of the undeformed
    metric and the sign of the deformation parameter.

Title: A repulsive skyrmion chain as guiding track for a race track memory,
Abstract: A skyrmion racetrack design is proposed that allows for thermally stable skyrmions to code information and dynamical pinning sites that move with the applied current. This concept solves the problem of intrinsic distributions of pinning times and pinning currents of skyrmions at static geometrical or magnetic pinning sites. The dynamical pinning sites are realized by a skyrmion carrying wire, where the skyrmion repulsion is used in order to keep the skyrmions at equal distances. The information is coded by an additional layer where the presence and absence of a skyrmion is used to code the information. The lowest energy barrier for a data loss is calculated to be DE = 55 kBT300 which is sufficient for long time thermal stability.

Title: Is the annual growth rate in balance of trade time series for Ireland nonlinear,
Abstract: We describe the Time Series Multivariate Adaptive Regressions Splines
(TSMARS) method. This method is useful for identifying nonlinear structure in a
time series. We use TSMARS to model the annual change in the balance of trade
for Ireland from 1970 to 2007. We compare the TSMARS estimate with long memory
ARFIMA estimates and long-term parsimonious linear models. We show that the
change in the balance of trade is nonlinear and possesses weakly long range
effects. Moreover, we compare the period prior to the introduction of the
Intrastat system in 1993 with the period from 1993 onward. Here we show that in
the earlier period the series had a substantial linear signal embedded in it
suggesting that estimation efforts in the earlier period may have resulted in
an over-smoothed series.

Title: Classification of digital affine noncommutative geometries,
Abstract: It is known that connected translation invariant $n$-dimensional
noncommutative differentials $d x^i$ on the algebra $k[x^1,\cdots,x^n]$ of
polynomials in $n$-variables over a field $k$ are classified by commutative
algebras $V$ on the vector space spanned by the coordinates. This data also
applies to construct differentials on the Heisenberg algebra `spacetime' with
relations $[x^\mu,x^\nu]=\lambda\Theta^{\mu\nu}$ where $\Theta$ is an
antisymmetric matrix as well as to Lie algebras with pre-Lie algebra
structures. We specialise the general theory to the field $k={\ \mathbb{F}}_2$
of two elements, in which case translation invariant metrics (i.e. with
constant coefficients) are equivalent to making $V$ a Frobenius algebras. We
classify all of these and their quantum Levi-Civita bimodule connections for
$n=2,3$, with partial results for"

    Title: Optimal hedging under fast-varying stochastic volatility,
    Abstract: In a market with a rough or Markovian mean-reverting stochastic volatility there is no perfect hedge. Here it is shown how various delta-type hedging strategies perform and can be evaluated in such markets. A precise characterization of the hedging cost, the replication cost caused by the volatility fluctuations, is presented in an asymptotic regime of rapid mean reversion for the volatility fluctuations. The optimal dynamic asset based hedging strategy in the considered regime is identified as the so-called `practitioners' delta hedging scheme. It is moreover shown that the performances of the delta-type hedging schemes are essentially independent of the regularity of the volatility paths in the considered regime and that the hedging costs are related to a vega risk martingale whose magnitude is proportional to a new market risk parameter.

    Title: Adaptive Exploration-Exploitation Tradeoff for Opportunistic Bandits,
    Abstract: In this paper, we propose and study opportunistic bandits - a new variant of
    bandits where the regret of pulling a suboptimal arm varies under different
    environmental conditions, such as network load or produce price. When the
    load/price is low, so is the cost/regret of pulling a suboptimal arm (e.g.,
    trying a suboptimal network configuration). Therefore, intuitively, we could
    explore more when the load/price is low and exploit more when the load/price is
    high. Inspired by this intuition, we propose an Adaptive Upper-Confidence-Bound
    (AdaUCB) algorithm to adaptively balance the exploration-exploitation tradeoff
    for opportunistic bandits. We prove that AdaUCB achieves $O(\log T)$ regret
    with a smaller coefficient than the traditional UCB algorithm. Furthermore,
    AdaUCB achieves $O(1)$ regret with respect to $T$ if the exploration cost is
    zero when the load level is below a certain threshold. Last, based on both

    Title: Uniform Consistency in Stochastic Block Model with Continuous Community Label,
    Abstract: \cite{bickel2009nonparametric} developed a general framework to establish
    consistency of community detection in stochastic block model (SBM). In most
    applications of this framework, the community label is discrete. For example,
    in \citep{bickel2009nonparametric,zhao2012consistency} the degree corrected SBM
    is assumed to have a discrete degree parameter. In this paper, we generalize
    the method of \cite{bickel2009nonparametric} to give consistency analysis of
    maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) in SBM with continuous community label. We
    show that there is a standard procedure to transform the $||\cdot||_2$ error
    bound to the uniform error bound. We demonstrate the application of our general
    results by proving the uniform consistency (strong consistency) of the MLE in
    the exponential network model with interaction effect. Unfortunately, in the
    continuous parameter case, the condition ensuring uniform consistency we
    obtained is much stronger than that in the"

    Title: An iterative aggregation and disaggregation approach to the calculation of steady-state distributions of continuous processes,
    Abstract: A mapping of the process on a continuous configuration space to the symbolic
representation of the motion on a discrete state space will be combined with an
iterative aggregation and disaggregation (IAD) procedure to obtain steady state
distributions of the process. The IAD speeds up the convergence to the unit
eigenvector, which is the steady state distribution, by forming smaller
aggregated matrices whose unit eigenvector solutions are used to refine
approximations of the steady state vector until convergence is reached. This
method works very efficiently and can be used together with distributed or
parallel computing methods to obtain high resolution images of the steady state
distribution of complex atomistic or energy landscape type problems. The method
is illustrated in two numerical examples. In the first example the transition
matrix is assumed to be known. The second example represents an overdamped
Brownian motion process subject to a dichotomously changing external potential.

    Title: Waveform and Spectrum Management for Unmanned Aerial Systems Beyond 2025,
    Abstract: The application domains of civilian unmanned aerial systems (UASs) include agriculture, exploration, transportation, and entertainment. The expected growth of the UAS industry brings along new challenges: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flight control signaling requires low throughput, but extremely high reliability, whereas the data rate for payload data can be significant. This paper develops UAV number projections and concludes that small and micro UAVs will dominate the US airspace with accelerated growth between 2028 and 2032. We analyze the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform because it can provide the much needed flexibility, spectral efficiency, and, potentially, reliability and derive suitable OFDM waveform parameters as a function of UAV flight characteristics. OFDM also lends itself to agile spectrum access. Based on our UAV growth predictions, we conclude that dynamic spectrum access is needed and discuss the applicability of spectrum sharing techniques for future UAS communications.

    Abstract: The NVIDIA Volta GPU microarchitecture introduces a specialized unit, called
    ""Tensor Core"" that performs one matrix-multiply-and-accumulate on 4x4 matrices
    per clock cycle. The NVIDIA Tesla V100 accelerator, featuring the Volta
    microarchitecture, provides 640 Tensor Cores with a theoretical peak
    performance of 125 Tflops/s in mixed precision. In this paper, we investigate
    current approaches to program NVIDIA Tensor Cores, their performances and the

    Currently, NVIDIA provides three different ways of programming
    matrix-multiply-and-accumulate on Tensor Cores: the CUDA Warp Matrix Multiply
    Accumulate (WMMA) API, CUTLASS, a templated library based on WMMA, and cuBLAS
    GEMM. After experimenting with different approaches, we found that NVIDIA
    Tensor Cores can deliver up to 83 Tflops/s in mixed precision on a Tesla V100

    Title: Generic Singularities of 3D Piecewise Smooth Dynamical Systems,
    Abstract: The aim of this paper is to provide a discussion on current directions of
    research involving typical singularities of 3D nonsmooth vector fields. A brief
    survey of known results is presented. The main purpose of this work is to
    describe the dynamical features of a fold-fold singularity in its most basic
    form and to give a complete and detailed proof of its local structural
    stability (or instability). In addition, classes of all topological types of a
    fold-fold singularity are intrinsically characterized. Such proof essentially
    follows firstly from some lines laid out by Colombo, García, Jeffrey,
    Teixeira and others and secondly offers a rigorous mathematical treatment under
    clear and crisp assumptions and solid arguments. One should to highlight that
    the geometric-topological methods employed lead us to the completely
    mathematical understanding of the dynamics around a T-singularity. This
    approach lends itself to applications in generic bifurcation theory. It is
    worth to say that such subject is still poorly understood in higher dimension."

    Title: Exploring the Space of Black-box Attacks on Deep Neural Networks,
    Abstract: Existing black-box attacks on deep neural networks (DNNs) so far have largely
    focused on transferability, where an adversarial instance generated for a
    locally trained model can ""transfer"" to attack other learning models. In this
    paper, we propose novel Gradient Estimation black-box attacks for adversaries
    with query access to the target model's class probabilities, which do not rely
    on transferability. We also propose strategies to decouple the number of
    queries required to generate each adversarial sample from the dimensionality of
    the input. An iterative variant of our attack achieves close to 100%
    adversarial success rates for both targeted and untargeted attacks on DNNs. We
    carry out extensive experiments for a thorough comparative evaluation of
    black-box attacks and show that the proposed Gradient Estimation attacks
    outperform all transferability based black-box attacks we tested on both MNIST
    and CIFAR-10 datasets, achieving adversarial success rates similar to well
    known, state-of-the-art white-box attacks. We also apply the Gradient

    Title: Data-Driven Sparse Sensor Placement for Reconstruction,
    Abstract: Optimal sensor placement is a central challenge in the design, prediction,
    estimation, and control of high-dimensional systems. High-dimensional states
    can often leverage a latent low-dimensional representation, and this inherent
    compressibility enables sparse sensing. This article explores optimized sensor
    placement for signal reconstruction based on a tailored library of features
    extracted from training data. Sparse point sensors are discovered using the
    singular value decomposition and QR pivoting, which are two ubiquitous matrix
    computations that underpin modern linear dimensionality reduction. Sparse
    sensing in a tailored basis is contrasted with compressed sensing, a universal
    signal recovery method in which an unknown signal is reconstructed via a sparse
    representation in a universal basis. Although compressed sensing can recover a
    wider class of signals, we demonstrate the benefits of exploiting known
    patterns in data with optimized sensing. In particular, drastic reductions in

Title: On the affine random walk on the torus,
Abstract: Let $\mu$ be a borelian probability measure on
$\mathbf{G}:=\mathrm{SL}_d(\mathbb{Z}) \ltimes \mathbb{T}^d$. Define, for $x\in
\mathbb{T}^d$, a random walk starting at $x$ denoting for $n\in \mathbb{N}$, \[
\left\{\begin{array}{rcl} X_0 &=&x\\ X_{n+1} &=& a_{n+1} X_n + b_{n+1}
\end{array}\right. \] where $((a_n,b_n))\in \mathbf{G}^\mathbb{N}$ is an iid
sequence of law $\mu$.
Then, we denote by $\mathbb{P}_x$ the measure on $(\mathbb{T}^d)^\mathbb{N}$
that is the image of $\mu^{\otimes \mathbb{N}}$ by the map $\left((g_n) \mapsto

Title: A Novel Approach to Predicting Protein-Protein Interactions Using Machine Learning,
Abstract: Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play a crucial role in various cellular processes. Accurate prediction of PPIs is essential for understanding complex biological systems. In this study, we propose a novel machine learning approach for predicting PPIs using graph-based features derived from protein sequences and structures. We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness compared to existing methods. Our results show significant improvements in prediction accuracy, suggesting that our approach could greatly enhance our understanding of cellular processes."

    Title: Tidal disruptions by rotating black holes: relativistic hydrodynamics with Newtonian codes,
    Abstract: We propose an approximate approach for studying the relativistic regime of
    stellar tidal disruptions by rotating massive black holes. It combines an exact
    relativistic description of the hydrodynamical evolution of a test fluid in a
    fixed curved spacetime with a Newtonian treatment of the fluid's self-gravity.
    Explicit expressions for the equations of motion are derived for Kerr spacetime
    using two different coordinate systems. We implement the new methodology within
    an existing Newtonian Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics code and show that
    including the additional physics involves very little extra computational cost.
    We carefully explore the validity of the novel approach by first testing its
    ability to recover geodesic motion, and then by comparing the outcome of tidal
    disruption simulations against previous relativistic studies. We further
    compare simulations in Boyer--Lindquist and Kerr--Schild coordinates and
    conclude that our approach allows accurate simulation even of tidal disruption
    events where the star penetrates deeply inside the tidal radius of a rotating
    black hole. Finally, we use the new method to"

    Title: A promise checked is a promise kept: Inspection Testing,
    Abstract: Occasionally, developers need to ensure that the compiler treats their code
    in a specific way that is only visible by inspecting intermediate or final
    compilation artifacts. This is particularly common with carefully crafted
    compositional libraries, where certain usage patterns are expected to trigger
    an intricate sequence of compiler optimizations -- stream fusion is a
    well-known example.
    The developer of such a library has to manually inspect build artifacts and
    check for the expected properties. Because this is too tedious to do often, it
    will likely go unnoticed if the property is broken by a change to the library
    code, its dependencies or the compiler. The lack of automation has led to
    released versions of such libraries breaking their documented promises.
    This indicates that there is an unrecognized need for a new testing paradigm,
    inspection testing, where the programmer declaratively describes non-functional
    properties of an compilation artifact and the compiler checks these properties.
    We define inspection testing abstractly, implement it in the context of Haskell
    and show that it increases the quality of such libraries.

    Title: The NIEP,
    Abstract: The nonnegative inverse eigenvalue problem (NIEP) asks which lists of \( n \) complex numbers (counting multiplicity) occur as the eigenvalues of some \( n \)-by-\( n \) entry-wise nonnegative matrix. The NIEP has a long history and is a known hard (perhaps the hardest in matrix analysis?) and sought after problem. Thus, there are many subproblems and relevant results in a variety of directions. We survey most work on the problem and its several variants, with an emphasis on recent results, and include 130 references. The survey is divided into: a) the single eigenvalue problems; b) necessary conditions; c) low dimensional results; d) sufficient conditions; e) appending 0's to achieve realizability; f) the graph NIEP's; g) Perron similarities; and h) the relevance of Jordan structure.

    Title: Equations of $\,\overline{M}_{0,n}$,
    Abstract: Following work of Keel and Tevelev, we give explicit polynomials in the Cox
    ring of $\mathbb{P}^1\times\cdots\times\mathbb{P}^{n-3}$ that, conjecturally,
    determine $\overline{M}_{0,n}$ as a subscheme. Using Macaulay2, we prove that
    these equations generate the ideal for $n=5, 6, 7, 8$. For $n \leq 6$ we give a
    cohomological proof that these polynomials realize $\overline{M}_{0,n}$ as a
    projective variety, embedded in $\mathbb{P}^{(n-2)!-1}$ by the complete log
    canonical linear system.

    Title: An improved parametric model for hysteresis loop approximation,
    Abstract: A number of improvements have been added to the existing analytical model of
    hysteresis loop defined in parametric form. In particular, three phase shifts
    are included in the model, which permits to tilt the hysteresis loop smoothly
    by the required angle at the split point as well as to smoothly change the
    curvature of the loop. As a result, the error of approximation of a hysteresis
    loop by the improved model does not exceed 1%, which is several times less than
    the error of the existing model. The improved model is capable of approximating
    most of the known types of rate-independent symmetrical hysteresis loops
    encountered in the practice of physical measurements. The model allows building
    smooth, piecewise-linear, hybrid, minor, mirror-reflected, inverse, reverse,
    double and triple loops. One of the possible applications of the model
    developed is linearization of a probe microscope piezoscanner. The improved
    model can be found useful for the tasks of simulation of scientific instruments
    that contain hysteresis elements"

    Title: Low-level Active Visual Navigation: Increasing robustness of vision-based localization using potential fields,
    Abstract: This paper proposes a low-level visual navigation algorithm to improve visual
localization of a mobile robot. The algorithm, based on artificial potential
fields, associates each feature in the current image frame with an attractive
or neutral potential energy, with the objective of generating a control action
that drives the vehicle towards the goal, while still favoring feature rich
areas within a local scope, thus improving the localization performance. One
key property of the proposed method is that it does not rely on mapping, and
therefore it is a lightweight solution that can be deployed on miniaturized
aerial robots, in which memory and computational power are major constraints.
Simulations and real experimental results using a mini quadrotor equipped with
a downward looking camera demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively
drive the vehicle to a designated goal through a path that prevents
localization failure.

    Title: Gaussian Process based Passivation of a Class of Nonlinear Systems with Unknown Dynamics,
    Abstract: The paper addresses the problem of passivation of a class of nonlinear systems where the dynamics are unknown. For this purpose, we use the highly flexible, data-driven Gaussian process regression for the identification of the unknown dynamics for feed-forward compensation. The closed loop system of the nonlinear system, the Gaussian process model and a feedback control law is guaranteed to be semi-passive with a specific probability. The predicted variance of the Gaussian process regression is used to bound the model error which additionally allows to specify the state space region where the closed-loop system behaves passive. Finally, the theoretical results are illustrated by a simulation.

    $(\Phi,\Psi)$ is Jordan-triple multiplicative if $\Phi$ is a
    pointwise-generalized-inverse of $\Psi$ and the latter is a
    pointwise-generalized-inverse of $\Phi$. We study the basic properties of this
    maps in connection with Jordan homomorphism, triple homomorphisms and strongly
    preservers. We also determine conditions to guarantee the automatic continuity
    of the pointwise-generalized-inverse of continuous operator between

    Title: Demand-Independent Optimal Tolls,
    Abstract: Wardrop equilibria in nonatomic congestion games are in general inefficient as they do not induce an optimal flow that minimizes the total travel time. Network tolls are a prominent and popular way to induce an optimum flow in equilibrium. The classical approach to find such tolls is marginal cost pricing which requires the exact knowledge of the demand on the network. In this paper, we investigate under which conditions demand-independent optimum tolls exist that induce the system optimum flow for any travel demand in the network. We give several characterizations for the existence of such tolls both in terms of the cost structure and the network structure of the game. Specifically we show that demand-independent optimum tolls exist if and only if the edge cost functions are shifted monomials as used by the Bureau of Public Roads. Moreover, non-negative demand-independent optimum tolls exist when the network is a directed acyclic multi-graph. Finally, we show that any network with a single origin-destination pair admits demand-independent optimum tolls that, although not necessarily non-negative, satisfy a budget constraint.

    Title: Driver Action Prediction Using Deep (Bidirectional) Recurrent Neural Network,
    Abstract: Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) can be significantly improved with
    effective driver action prediction (DAP). Predicting driver actions early and
    accurately can help mitigate the effects of potentially unsafe driving
    behaviors and avoid possible accidents. In this paper, we formulate driver
    action prediction as a timeseries anomaly prediction problem. While the anomaly
    (driver actions of interest) detection might be trivial in this context,
    finding patterns that consistently precede an anomaly requires searching for or
    extracting features across multi-modal sensory inputs. We present such a driver
    action prediction system, including a real-time data acquisition, processing
    and learning framework for predicting future or impending driver action. The
    proposed system incorporates camera-based knowledge of the driving environment
    and the driver themselves, in addition to traditional vehicle dynamics. It then
    uses a deep bidirectional recurrent neural network (DBRNN) to learn the
    correlation between sensory inputs and impending driver behavior achieving
    accurate and high horizon action prediction. The proposed system performs
    better than other existing systems on driver action prediction tasks and can

Title: Big Data Classification Using Augmented Decision Trees,
Abstract: We present an algorithm for classification tasks on big data. Experiments
conducted as part of this study indicate that the algorithm can be as accurate
as ensemble methods such as random forests or gradient boosted trees. Unlike
ensemble methods, the models produced by the algorithm can be easily
interpreted. The algorithm is based on a divide and conquer strategy and
consists of two steps. The first step consists of using a decision tree to
segment the large dataset. By construction, decision trees attempt to create
homogeneous class distributions in their leaf nodes. However, non-homogeneous
leaf nodes are usually produced. The second step of the algorithm consists of
using a suitable classifier to determine the class labels for the
non-homogeneous leaf nodes. The decision tree segment provides a coarse segment
profile while the leaf level classifier can provide information about the
attributes that affect the label within a segment.

Title: Controlling thermal emission of phonon by magnetic metasurfaces,
Abstract: Our experiment shows that the thermal emission of phonon can be controlled by magnetic resonance (MR) mode in a metasurface (MTS). Through changing the structural parameter of metasurface, the MR wavelength can be tuned to the phonon resonance wavelength. This introduces a strong coupling between phonon and MR, which results in an anticrossing phonon-plasmons mode. In the process, we can manipulate the polarization and angular radiation of thermal emission of phonon. Such metasurface provides a new kind of thermal emission structures for various thermal management applications.

Title: The Bane of Low-Dimensionality Clustering,
Abstract: In this paper, we give a conditional lower bound of \( n^{\Omega(k)} \) on running time for the classic k-median and k-means clustering objectives (where \( n \) is the size of the input), even in low-dimensional Euclidean space of dimension four, assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH). We also consider k-median (and k-means) with penalties where each point need not be assigned to a center, in which case it must pay a penalty, and extend our lower bound to at least three-dimensional Euclidean space. This stands in stark contrast to many other geometric problems such as the traveling salesman problem, or computing an independent set of unit spheres. While these problems benefit from the so-called (limited) blessing of dimensionality, as they can be solved in time \( n^{O(k^{1-1/d})} \) or \( 2^{n^{1-1/d}} \) in \( d \) dimensions, our work shows that widely-used clustering objectives have a lower bound of \( n^{\Omega(k)} \), even in dimension four.

    Title: A Robotic Auto-Focus System based on Deep Reinforcement Learning,
    Abstract: Considering its advantages in dealing with high-dimensional visual input and
    learning control policies in discrete domain, Deep Q Network (DQN) could be an
    alternative method of traditional auto-focus means in the future. In this
    paper, based on Deep Reinforcement Learning, we propose an end-to-end approach
    that can learn auto-focus policies from visual input and finish at a clear spot
    automatically. We demonstrate that our method - discretizing the action space
    with coarse to fine steps and applying DQN is not only a solution to auto-focus
    but also a general approach towards vision-based control problems. Separate
    phases of training in virtual and real environments are applied to obtain an
    effective model. Virtual experiments, which are carried out after the virtual
    training phase, indicates that our method could achieve 100% accuracy on a
    certain view with different focus range. Further training on real robots could
    eliminate the deviation between the simulator and real scenario, leading to
    reliable performances in real applications.

Title: Causal Interventions for Fairness,
Abstract: Most approaches in algorithmic fairness constrain machine learning methods so that the resulting predictions satisfy one of several intuitive notions of fairness. While this may help private companies comply with non-discrimination laws or avoid negative publicity, we believe it is often too little, too late. By the time the training data is collected, individuals in disadvantaged groups have already suffered from discrimination and lost opportunities due to factors out of their control. In the present work, we focus instead on interventions such as a new public policy, and in particular, how to maximize their positive effects while improving the fairness of the overall system. We use causal methods to model the effects of interventions, allowing for potential interference—each individual's outcome may depend on who else receives the intervention. We demonstrate this with an example of allocating a budget of teaching resources using a dataset of schools in New York City.

    Title: Predicting Protein-Protein Interactions Using Deep Learning,
    Abstract: This paper introduces a deep learning approach to predict protein-protein interactions (PPIs) using high-throughput screening data. The model is trained on a large dataset of known PPIs and can accurately predict potential interactions between proteins not previously tested. The method leverages convolutional neural networks to extract features from the protein sequences and graph neural networks to model the interactions within and between proteins. The results show that this deep learning model outperforms traditional machine learning methods in predicting PPIs."

    Title: The Leray transform: factorization, dual $CR$ structures and model hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^2$,
    Abstract: We compute the exact norms of the Leray transforms for a family
    $\mathcal{S}_{\beta}$ of unbounded hypersurfaces in two complex dimensions. The
    $\mathcal{S}_{\beta}$ generalize the Heisenberg group, and provide local
    projective approximations to any smooth, strongly $\mathbb{C}$-convex
    hypersurface $\mathcal{S}_{\beta}$ to two orders of tangency. This work is then
    examined in the context of projective dual $CR$-structures and the
    corresponding pair of canonical dual Hardy spaces associated to
    $\mathcal{S}_{\beta}$, leading to a universal description of the Leray
    transform and a factorization of the transform through orthogonal projection
    onto the conjugate dual Hardy space.

Title: Local Symmetry and Global Structure in Adaptive Voter Models,
Abstract: ""Coevolving"" or ""adaptive"" voter models (AVMs) are natural systems for
modeling the emergence of mesoscopic structure from local networked processes
driven by conflict and homophily. Because of this, many methods for
approximating the long-run behavior of AVMs have been proposed over the last
decade. However, most such methods are either restricted in scope, expensive in
computation, or inaccurate in predicting important statistics. In this work, we
develop a novel, second-order moment closure approximation method for studying
the equilibrium mesoscopic structure of AVMs and apply it to binary-state
rewire-to-random and rewire-to-same model variants with random state-switching.
This framework exploits an asymmetry in voting events that enables us to derive
analytic approximations for the fast-timescale dynamics. The resulting
numerical approximations enable the computation of key properties of the model
behavior, such as the location of the fragmentation transition and the
equilibrium active edge density, across the entire range of state densities.
Numerically, they are nearly exact for the rewire-to-random model, and"

Abstract: For many technological applications of superconductors the performance of a
material is determined by the highest current it can carry losslessly - the
critical current. In turn, the critical current can be controlled by adding
non-superconducting defects in the superconductor matrix. Here we report on
systematic comparison of different local and global optimization strategies to
predict optimal structures of pinning centers leading to the highest possible
critical currents. We demonstrate performance of these methods for a
superconductor with randomly placed spherical, elliptical, and columnar

Title: A Game of Martingales,
Abstract: We consider a two player dynamic game played over $T \leq \infty$ periods. In
each period each player chooses any probability distribution with support on
$[0,1]$ with a given mean, where the mean is the realized value of the draw
from the previous period. The player with the highest realization in the period
achieves a payoff of $1$, and the other player, $0$; and each player seeks to
maximize the discounted sum of his per-period payoffs over the whole time
horizon. We solve for the unique subgame perfect equilibrium of this game, and
establish properties of the equilibrium strategies and payoffs in the limit.
The solution and comparative statics thereof provide insight about
intertemporal choice with status concerns. In particular we find that patient
players take fewer risks.

    Title: Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Power Allocation in Wireless Networks,
    Abstract: This work demonstrates the potential of deep reinforcement learning
    techniques for transmit power control in emerging and future wireless networks.
    Various techniques have been proposed in the literature to find near-optimal
    power allocations, often by solving a challenging optimization problem. Most of
    these algorithms are not scalable to large networks in real-world scenarios
    because of their computational complexity and instantaneous cross-cell channel
    state information (CSI) requirement. In this paper, a model-free distributively
    executed dynamic power allocation scheme is developed based on deep
    reinforcement learning. Each transmitter collects CSI and quality of service
    (QoS) information from several neighbors and adapts its own transmit power
    accordingly. The objective is to maximize a weighted sum-rate utility function,
    which can be particularized to achieve maximum sum-rate or proportionally fair
    scheduling (with weights that are changing over time). Both random variations
    and delays in the CSI are inherently addressed using deep Q-learning. For a
    typical network architecture, the proposed algorithm is shown to achieve
    near-optimal power allocation in real time based on delayed CSI measurements

    Title: Probabilistic Matrix Factorization for Automated Machine Learning,
    Abstract: In order to achieve state-of-the-art performance, modern machine learning
    techniques require careful data pre-processing and hyperparameter tuning.
    Moreover, given the ever increasing number of machine learning models being
    developed, model selection is becoming increasingly important. Automating the
    selection and tuning of machine learning pipelines consisting of data
    pre-processing methods and machine learning models, has long been one of the
    goals of the machine learning community. In this paper, we tackle this
    meta-learning task by combining ideas from collaborative filtering and Bayesian
    optimization. Using probabilistic matrix factorization techniques and
    acquisition functions from Bayesian optimization, we exploit experiments
    performed in hundreds of different datasets to guide the exploration of the
    space of possible pipelines. In our experiments, we show that our approach
    quickly identifies high-performing pipelines across a wide range of datasets,
    significantly outperforming the current state-of-the-art."

    Title: Fast Compressed Self-Indexes with Deterministic Linear-Time Construction,
    Abstract: We introduce a compressed suffix array representation that, on a text $T$ of length $n$ over an alphabet of size $\sigma$, can be built in $O(n)$ deterministic time, within $O(n\log\sigma)$ bits of working space, and counts the number of occurrences of any pattern $P$ in $T$ in time $O(|P| + \log\log_w \sigma)$ on a RAM machine of $w=\Omega(\log n)$-bit words. This new index outperforms all the other compressed indexes that can be built in linear deterministic time, and some others. The only faster indexes can be built in linear time only in expectation, or require $\Theta(n\log n)$ bits. We also show that, by using $O(n\log\sigma)$ bits, we can build in linear time an index that counts in time $O(|P|/\log_\sigma n + \log n(\log\log n)^2)$, which is RAM-optimal for $w=\Theta(\log n)$ and sufficiently long patterns.

    Title: A Heuristic Search Algorithm Using the Stability of Learning Algorithms in Certain Scenarios as the Fitness Function: An Artificial General Intelligence Engineering Approach,
    Abstract: This paper presents a non-manual design engineering method based on heuristic
    search algorithm to search for candidate agents in the solution space which
    formed by artificial intelligence agents modeled on the base of
    bionics. Compared with the artificial design method represented by meta-learning
    and the bionics method represented by the neural architecture chip, this method
    is more feasible for realizing artificial general intelligence, and it has a
    much better interaction with cognitive neuroscience; at the same time, the
    engineering method is based on the theoretical hypothesis that the final
    learning algorithm is stable in certain scenarios and has generalization
    ability in various scenarios. The paper discusses the theory preliminarily and
    proposes the possible correlation between the theory and the fixed-point
    theorem in the field of mathematics. Limited by the author's knowledge level,
    this correlation is proposed only as a kind of conjecture.

    Title: Shift-Coupling of Random Rooted Graphs and Networks,
    Abstract: In this paper, we present a result similar to the shift-coupling result of
    Thorisson (1996) in the context of random graphs and networks. The result is
    that a given random rooted network can be obtained by changing the root of
    another given one if and only if the distributions of the two agree on the
    invariant sigma-field. Several applications of the result are presented for the
    case of unimodular networks. In particular, it is shown that the distribution
    of a unimodular network is uniquely determined by its restriction to the
    invariant sigma-filed. Also, the theorem is applied to the existence of an
    invariant transport kernel that balances between two given (discrete) measures
    on the vertices. An application is the existence of a so called extra head
    scheme for the Bernoulli process on an infinite unimodular graph. Moreover, a
    construction is presented for balancing transport kernels that is a
    generalization of the Gale-Shapley stable matching algorithm in bipartite
    graphs. Another application is on"

Title: Improving Protein Gamma-Turn Prediction Using Inception Capsule Networks,
Abstract: Protein gamma-turn prediction is useful in protein function studies and
experimental design. Several methods for gamma-turn prediction have been
developed, but the results were unsatisfactory with Matthew correlation
coefficients (MCC) around 0.2-0.4. One reason for the low prediction accuracy
is the limited capacity of the methods; in particular, the traditional
machine-learning methods like SVM may not extract high-level features well to
distinguish between turn or non-turn. Hence, it is worthwhile exploring new
machine-learning methods for the prediction. A cutting-edge deep neural
network, named Capsule Network (CapsuleNet), provides a new opportunity for
gamma-turn prediction. Even when the number of input samples is relatively
small, the capsules from CapsuleNet are very effective to extract high-level
features for classification tasks. Here, we propose a deep inception capsule
network for gamma-turn prediction. Its performance on the gamma-turn benchmark
GT320 achieved an MCC of 0.45, which significantly outperformed the previous
best method with an MCC"

    Title: Learning latent structure of large random graphs,
    Abstract: In this paper, we estimate the distribution of hidden nodes weights in large
random graphs from the observation of very few edges weights. In this very
sparse setting, the first non-asymptotic risk bounds for maximum likelihood
estimators (MLE) are established. The proof relies on the construction of a
graphical model encoding conditional dependencies that is extremely efficient
to study n-regular graphs obtained using a round-robin scheduling. This
graphical model allows to prove geometric loss of memory properties and deduce
the asymptotic behavior of the likelihood function. Following a classical
construction in learning theory, the asymptotic likelihood is used to define a
measure of performance for the MLE. Risk bounds for the MLE are finally
obtained by subgaussian deviation results derived from concentration
inequalities for Markov chains applied to our graphical model.

    Title: Analyzing the Impact of Different Teaching Methods on Student Performance,
    Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of various teaching methodologies on student performance. We conducted experiments with four different teaching approaches and measured the outcomes using standardized tests. The results indicate that interactive learning methods significantly improve student engagement and understanding compared to traditional lecture-based instruction. Additionally, we found that blended learning environments, which combine online and in-person instruction, yield the highest academic achievement among students. These findings suggest that educators should consider incorporating more interactive and blended elements into their teaching practices to enhance learning outcomes."

    Title: The exit time finite state projection scheme: bounding exit distributions and occupation measures of continuous-time Markov chains,
    Abstract: We introduce the exit time finite state projection (ETFSP) scheme, a
    truncation-based method that yields approximations to the exit distribution and
    occupation measure associated with the time of exit from a domain (i.e., the
    time of first passage to the complement of the domain) of time-homogeneous
    continuous-time Markov chains. We prove that: (i) the computed approximations
    bound the measures from below; (ii) the total variation distances between the
    approximations and the measures decrease monotonically as states are added to
    the truncation; and (iii) the scheme converges, in the sense that, as the
    truncation tends to the entire state space, the total variation distances tend
    to zero. Furthermore, we give a computable bound on the total variation
    distance between the exit distribution and its approximation, and we delineate
    the cases in which the bound is sharp. We also revisit the related finite state
    projection scheme and give a comprehensive account of its theoretical
    properties. We"

Title: Calibration of a two-state pitch-wise HMM method for note segmentation in Automatic Music Transcription systems,
Abstract: Many methods for automatic music transcription involves a multi-pitch
estimation method that estimates an activity score for each pitch. A second
processing step, called note segmentation, has to be performed for each pitch
in order to identify the time intervals when the notes are played. In this
study, a pitch-wise two-state on/off firstorder Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is
developed for note segmentation. A complete parametrization of the HMM sigmoid
function is proposed, based on its original regression formulation, including a
parameter alpha of slope smoothing and beta? of thresholding contrast. A
comparative evaluation of different note segmentation strategies was performed,
differentiated according to whether they use a fixed threshold, called ""Hard
Thresholding"" (HT), or a HMM-based thresholding method, called ""Soft
Thresholding"" (ST). This evaluation was done following MIREX standards and
using the MAPS dataset. Also, different transcription scenarios and recording
natures were tested using three units of the Degradation toolbox. Results show

Title: Multiple regimes and coalescence timescales for massive black hole pairs ; the critical role of galaxy formation physics,
Abstract: We discuss the latest results of numerical simulations following the orbital
decay of massive black hole pairs in galaxy mergers. We highlight important
differences between gas-poor and gas-rich hosts, and between orbital evolution
taking place at high redshift as opposed to low redshift. Two effects have a
huge impact and are rather novel in the context of massive black hole binaries.
The first is the increase in characteristic density of galactic nuclei of
merger remnants as galaxies are more compact at high redshift due to the way
dark halo collapse depends on redshift. This leads naturally to hardening
timescales due to 3-body encounters that should decrease by two orders of
magnitude up to \( z=4 \). It explains naturally the short binary coalescence
timescale, \(\sim 10\) Myr, found in novel cosmological simulations that follow
binary evolution from galactic to milliparsec scales. The second one is the
inhomogeneity of the interstellar medium in massive gas-rich disks at high

Title: Gaiotto's Lagrangian subvarieties via loop groups,
Abstract: The purpose of this note is to give a simple proof of the fact that a certain
substack, defined in [2], of the moduli stack \( T^* \text{Bun}_G(\Sigma) \) of Higgs
bundles over a curve \( \Sigma \), for a connected, simply connected semisimple
group \( G \), possesses a Lagrangian structure. The substack, roughly speaking,
consists of images under the moment map of global sections of principal
\( G \)-bundles over \( \Sigma \) twisted by a smooth symplectic variety with a
Hamiltonian \( G \)-action.

    Title: A Univariate Bound of Area Under ROC,
    Abstract: Area under ROC (AUC) is an important metric for binary classification and bipartite ranking problems. However, it is difficult to directly optimizing AUC as a learning objective, so most existing algorithms are based on optimizing a surrogate loss to AUC. One significant drawback of these surrogate losses is that they require pairwise comparisons among training data, which leads to slow running time and increasing local storage for online learning. In this work, we describe a new surrogate loss based on a reformulation of the AUC risk, which does not require pairwise comparison but rankings of the predictions. We further show that the ranking operation can be avoided, and the learning objective obtained based on this surrogate enjoys linear complexity in time and storage. We perform experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the online and batch algorithms for AUC optimization based on the proposed surrogate loss.

Title: A Hybrid Framework for Multi-Vehicle Collision Avoidance,
Abstract: With the recent surge of interest in UAVs for civilian services, the
importance of developing tractable multi-agent analysis techniques that provide
safety and performance guarantees have drastically increased. Hamilton-Jacobi
(HJ) reachability has successfully provided these guarantees to small-scale
systems and is flexible in terms of system dynamics. However, the exponential
complexity scaling of HJ reachability with respect to system dimension prevents
its direct application to larger-scale problems where the number of vehicles is
greater than two. In this paper, we propose a collision avoidance algorithm
using a hybrid framework for N+1 vehicles through higher-level control logic
given any N-vehicle collision avoidance algorithm. Our algorithm conservatively
approximates a guaranteed-safe region in the joint state space of the N+1
vehicles and produces a safety-preserving controller. In addition, our
algorithm does not incur significant additional computation cost. We
demonstrate our proposed method in simulation.

Abstract: This study explores the application of deep learning techniques to predict protein-protein interactions (PPIs) using high-throughput experimental data. We propose a novel deep neural network architecture specifically designed to handle the complexity and variability of PPI datasets.

    Title: Deep Learning for Predicting Protein-Protein Interactions Using Graph Neural Networks,
    Abstract: Predicting protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is crucial for understanding cellular functions and disease mechanisms. In this study, we propose a novel deep learning approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict PPIs. Our method leverages the structural information of proteins represented as graphs, where nodes correspond to amino acid residues and edges represent spatial proximity or functional interactions. We train our GNN model on a large-scale dataset of known PPIs and evaluate its performance on both in-house and publicly available test sets. The results show that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and robustness across different species and interaction types. Additionally, we provide an analysis of the key features contributing to successful predictions, which can guide future experimental design and validation efforts."

    Title: Graph of Virtual Actors (GOVA): a Big Data Analytics Architecture for IoT,
    Abstract: With the emergence of cloud computing and sensor technologies, Big Data
    analytics for the Internet of Things (IoT) has become the main force behind
    many innovative solutions for our society's problems. This paper provides
    practical explanations for the question ""why is the number of Big Data
    applications that succeed and have an effect on our daily life so limited,
    compared with all of the solutions proposed and tested in the literature?"",
    with examples taken from Smart Grids. We argue that ""noninvariants"" are the
    most challenging issues in IoT applications, which can be easily revealed if we
    use the term ""invariant"" to replace the more common terms such as
    ""information"", ""knowledge"", or ""insight"" in any Big Data for IoT research. From
    our experience with developing Smart Grid applications, we produced a list of
    ""noninvariants"", which we believe to be the main causes of the gaps between Big
    Data in a laboratory and in practice in IoT applications. This paper also
    proposes Graph of Virtual Actors (GOVA) as a Big Data"

Title: Specifying a positive threshold function via extremal points,
Abstract: An extremal point of a positive threshold Boolean function \( f \) is either a
maximal zero or a minimal one. It is known that if \( f \) depends on all its
variables, then the set of its extremal points completely specifies \( f \) within
the universe of threshold functions. However, in some cases, \( f \) can be
specified by a smaller set. The minimum number of points in such a set is the
specification number of \( f \). It was shown in [S.-T. Hu. Threshold Logic, 1965]
that the specification number of a threshold function of \( n \) variables is at
least \( n+1 \). In [M. Anthony, G. Brightwell, and J. Shawe-Taylor. On specifying
Boolean functions by labelled examples. Discrete Applied Mathematics, 1995] it
was proved that this bound is attained for nested functions and conjectured
that for all other threshold functions the specification number is strictly
greater than \( n+1 \). In the present paper, we resolve this conjecture negatively"

Title: Improved Training of Wasserstein GANs,
Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are powerful generative models, but
suffer from training instability. The recently proposed Wasserstein GAN (WGAN)
makes progress toward stable training of GANs, but sometimes can still generate
only low-quality samples or fail to converge. We find that these problems are
often due to the use of weight clipping in WGAN to enforce a Lipschitz
constraint on the critic, which can lead to undesired behavior. We propose an
alternative to clipping weights: penalize the norm of gradient of the critic
with respect to its input. Our proposed method performs better than standard
WGAN and enables stable training of a wide variety of GAN architectures with
almost no hyperparameter tuning, including 101-layer ResNets and language
models over discrete data. We also achieve high quality generations on CIFAR-10
and LSUN bedrooms.

    Title: Generating Visual Representations for Zero-Shot Classification,
    Abstract: This paper addresses the task of learning an image classifier when some categories are defined by semantic descriptions only (e.g., visual attributes) while the others are defined by exemplar images as well. This task is often referred to as the Zero-Shot classification task (ZSC). Most of the previous methods rely on learning a common embedding space allowing to compare visual features of unknown categories with semantic descriptions. This paper argues that these approaches are limited as i) efficient discriminative classifiers can't be used ii) classification tasks with seen and unseen categories (Generalized Zero-Shot Classification or GZSC) can't be addressed efficiently. In contrast, this paper suggests to address ZSC and GZSC by i) learning a conditional generator using seen classes ii) generate artificial training examples for the categories without exemplars. ZSC is then turned into a standard supervised learning problem. Experiments with 4 generative models and 5 datasets experimentally validate the approach, giving state-of-the-art results on both ZSC and GZSC.

    Title: Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting,
    Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a crucial role in various domains such as economics, finance, and environmental science. In recent years, deep learning models have emerged as powerful tools for time series forecasting due to their ability to capture complex temporal dependencies. This paper surveys the application of deep learning techniques, including recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), and gated recurrent units (GRUs), in time series forecasting. We discuss the advantages and limitations of these models, provide guidelines for model selection, and highlight best practices for training and evaluating deep learning-based time series forecasting models. We also present case studies and real-world applications to illustrate the effectiveness of deep learning approaches in this domain."

    Title: DADAM: A Consensus-based Distributed Adaptive Gradient Method for Online Optimization,
    Abstract: Adaptive gradient-based optimization methods such as ADAGRAD, RMSPROP, and
    ADAM are widely used in solving large-scale machine learning problems including
    deep learning. A number of schemes have been proposed in the literature aiming
    at parallelizing them, based on communications of peripheral nodes with a
    central node, but incur high communications cost. To address this issue, we
    develop a novel consensus-based distributed adaptive moment estimation method
    (DADAM) for online optimization over a decentralized network that enables data
    parallelization, as well as decentralized computation. The method is
    particularly useful, since it can accommodate settings where access to local
    data is allowed. Further, as established theoretically in this work, it can
    outperform centralized adaptive algorithms, for certain classes of loss
    functions used in applications. We analyze the convergence properties of the
    proposed algorithm and provide a dynamic regret bound on the convergence rate
    of adaptive moment estimation methods in both stochastic and deterministic
    settings. Empirical results demonstrate that DADAM works also well in practice
    and compares favor"

    Title: A mode-coupling theory analysis of the rotation driven translational motion of aqueous polyatomic ions,
    Abstract: In contrast to simple monatomic alkali and halide ions, complex polyatomic ions like nitrate, acetate, nitrite, chlorate etc. have not been studied in any great detail. Experiments have shown that diffusion of polyatomic ions exhibits many remarkable anomalies, notable among them is the fact that polyatomic ions with similar size show large difference in their diffusivity values. This fact has drawn relatively little interest in scientific discussions. We show here that a mode-coupling theory (MCT) can provide a physically meaningful interpretation of the anomalous diffusivity of polyatomic ions in water, by including the contribution of rotational jumps on translational friction. The two systems discussed here, namely aqueous nitrate ion and aqueous acetate ion, although have similar ionic radii exhibit largely different diffusivity values due to the differences in the rate of their rotational jump motions. We have further verified the mode-coupling theory formalism by comparing it with experimental and simulation results that agrees well with the theoretical prediction.

We also discuss the experimental challenges and potential solutions for implementing such a system."

    Title: Atmospheric Circulation and Cloud Evolution on the Highly Eccentric Extrasolar Planet HD 80606b,
    Abstract: Observations of the highly-eccentric (e~0.9) hot-Jupiter HD 80606b with
    Spitzer have provided some of best probes of the physics at work in exoplanet
    atmospheres. By observing HD 80606b during its periapse passage, atmospheric
    radiative, advective, and chemical timescales can be directly measured and used
    to constrain fundamental planetary properties such as rotation period, tidal
    dissipation rate, and atmospheric composition (including aerosols). Here we
    present three-dimensional general circulation models for HD 80606b that aim to
    further explore the atmospheric physics shaping HD 80606b's observed Spitzer
    phase curves. We find that our models that assume a planetary rotation period
    twice that of the pseudo-synchronous rotation period best reproduce the phase
    variations observed for HD~80606b near periapse passage with Spitzer.

    Title: Field-induced coexistence of $s_{++}$ and $s_{\pm}$ superconducting states in dirty multiband superconductors,
    Abstract: In multiband systems, such as iron-based superconductors, the superconducting
    states with locking and anti-locking of the interband phase differences, are
    usually considered as mutually exclusive. For example, a dirty two-band system
    with interband impurity scattering undergoes a sharp crossover between the
    $s_{\pm}$ state (which favors phase anti locking) and the $s_{++}$ state (which
    favors phase locking). We discuss here that the situation can be much more
    complex in the presence of an external field or superconducting currents. In an
    external applied magnetic field, dirty two-band superconductors do not feature
    a sharp $s_{\pm}\to s_{++}$ crossover but rather a washed-out crossover to a
    finite region in the parameter space where both $s_{\pm}$ and $s_{++}$ states
    can coexist for example as a lattice or a microemulsion of inclusions of
    different states. The current-c"

    Title: Exploration of Large Networks with Covariates via Fast and Universal Latent Space Model Fitting,
    Abstract: Latent space models are effective tools for statistical modeling and
    exploration of network data. These models can effectively model real world
    network characteristics such as degree heterogeneity, transitivity, homophily,
    etc. Due to their close connection to generalized linear models, it is also
    natural to incorporate covariate information in them. The current paper
    presents two universal fitting algorithms for networks with edge covariates:
    one based on nuclear norm penalization and the other based on projected
    gradient descent. Both algorithms are motivated by maximizing likelihood for a
    special class of inner-product models while working simultaneously for a wide
    range of different latent space models, such as distance models, which allow
    latent vectors to affect edge formation in flexible ways. These fitting
    methods, especially the one based on projected gradient descent, are fast and
    scalable to large networks. We obtain their rates of convergence for both
    inner-product models and beyond. The effectiveness of the modeling approach and
    fitting algorithms is demonstrated on five real world network datasets for
    different statistical tasks,"

Title: Near-Optimal Discrete Optimization for Experimental Design: A Regret Minimization Approach,
Abstract: The experimental design problem concerns the selection of k points from a
potentially large design pool of p-dimensional vectors, so as to maximize the
statistical efficiency regressed on the selected k design points. Statistical
efficiency is measured by optimality criteria, including A(verage),
D(eterminant), T(race), E(igen), V(ariance) and G-optimality. Except for the
T-optimality, exact optimization is NP-hard.
We propose a polynomial-time regret minimization framework to achieve a
$(1+\varepsilon)$ approximation with only $O(p/\varepsilon^2)$ design points,
for all the optimality criteria above.
In contrast, to the best of our knowledge, before our work, no
polynomial-time algorithm achieves $(1+\varepsilon)$ approximations for
D/E/G-optimality, and the best poly-time algorithm achieving
$(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation for A/V-optimality requires $k =
\Omega(p^2/\varepsilon)$ design points.

Title: Bayesian Network Regularized Regression for Modeling Urban Crime Occurrences,
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of statistical inference and prediction for processes defined on networks. We assume that the network is known and measures similarity, and our goal is to learn about an attribute associated with its vertices. Classical regression methods are not immediately applicable to this setting, as we would like our model to incorporate information from both network structure and pertinent covariates. Our proposed model consists of a generalized linear model with vertex indexed predictors and a basis expansion of their coefficients, allowing the coefficients to vary over the network. We employ a regularization procedure, cast as a prior distribution on the regression coefficients under a Bayesian setup, so that the predicted responses vary smoothly according to the topology of the network. We motivate the need for this model by examining occurrences of residential burglary in Boston, Massachusetts. Noting that crime rates are not spatially homogeneous, and that the rates appear to vary sharply across regions in the city, we construct a hierarchical model that addresses these issues and gives insight into spatial patterns of crime occurrences. Furthermore, we examine efficient expectation-maximization fitting algorithms and provide computationally-friendly methods for eliciting hyper-prior parameters.

    Title: COLOSSUS: A python toolkit for cosmology, large-scale structure, and dark matter halos,
    Abstract: This paper introduces Colossus, a public, open-source python package for
    calculations related to cosmology, the large-scale structure (LSS) of matter in
    the universe, and the properties of dark matter halos. The code is designed to
    be fast and easy to use, with a coherent, well-documented user interface. The
    cosmology module implements Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker cosmologies
    including curvature, relativistic species, and different dark energy equations
    of state, and provides fast computations of the linear matter power spectrum,
    variance, and correlation function. The LSS module is concerned with the
    properties of peaks in Gaussian random fields and halos in a statistical sense,
    including their peak height, peak curvature, halo bias, and mass function. The
    halo module deals with spherical overdensity radii and masses, density
    profiles, concentration, and the splashback radius. To facilitate the rapid
    exploration of these quantities, Colossus implements more than 40 different
    fitting functions from"

    Title: Hierarchy of exchange interactions in the triangular-lattice spin-liquid YbMgGaO$_{4}$,
    Abstract: The spin-1/2 triangular lattice antiferromagnet YbMgGaO$_{4}$ has attracted
    recent attention as a quantum spin-liquid candidate with the possible presence
    of off-diagonal anisotropic exchange interactions induced by spin-orbit
    coupling. Whether a quantum spin-liquid is stabilized or not depends on the
    interplay of various exchange interactions with chemical disorder that is
    inherent to the layered structure of the compound. We combine time-domain
    terahertz spectroscopy and inelastic neutron scattering measurements in the
    field polarized state of YbMgGaO$_{4}$ to obtain better microscopic insights on
    its exchange interactions. Terahertz spectroscopy in this fashion functions as
    high-field electron spin resonance and probes the spin-wave excitations at the
    Brillouin zone center, ideally complementing neutron scattering. A global
    spin-wave fit to all our spectroscopic data at fields over 4T, informed by the
    analysis of the terahertz spectroscopy linewidths, yields"

    Title: Recommendations for Marketing Campaigns in Telecommunication Business based on the footprint analysis,
    Abstract: A major investment made by a telecom operator goes into the infrastructure and its maintenance, while business revenues are proportional to how big and good the customer base is. We present a data-driven analytic strategy based on combinatorial optimization and analysis of historical data. The data cover historical mobility of the users in one region of Sweden during a week. Applying the proposed method to the case study, we have identified the optimal proportion of geo-demographic segments in the customer base, developed a functionality to assess the potential of a planned marketing campaign, and explored the problem of an optimal number and types of the geo-demographic segments to target through marketing campaigns. With the help of fuzzy logic, the conclusions of data analysis are automatically translated into comprehensible recommendations in a natural language.

    Title: Tailoring symmetric metallic and magnetic edge states of nanoribbon in semiconductive monolayer PtS2,
    Abstract: Fabrication of atomic scale of metallic wire remains challenging. In present work, a nanoribbon with two parallel symmetric metallic and magnetic edges was designed from semiconductive monolayer PtS2 by employing first-principles calculations based on density functional theory. Edge energy, bonding charge density, band structure and simulated STM of possible edges states of PtS2 were systematically studied. It was found that Pt-terminated edge nanoribbons were the relatively stable metallic and magnetic edge tailored from a noble transition metal dichalcogenides PtS2. The nanoribbon with two atomic metallic wires may have promising application as nano power transmission lines, which at least two lines are needed.

Title: Is there any polynomial upper bound for the universal labeling of graphs?,
Abstract: A {\it universal labeling} of a graph \( G \) is a labeling of the edge set in \( G \) such that in every orientation \( \ell \) of \( G \), for every two adjacent vertices \( v \) and \( u \), the sum of incoming edges of \( v \) and \( u \) in the oriented graph are different from each other. The {\it universal labeling number} of a graph \( G \) is the minimum number \( k \) such that \( G \) has a universal labeling from \( \{1, 2, \ldots, k\} \), denoted by \( \overrightarrow{\chi_u}(G) \). We have \( 2\Delta(G) - 2 \leq \overrightarrow{\chi_u}(G) \leq 2^{\Delta(G)} \), where \( \Delta(G) \) denotes the maximum degree of \( G \). In this work, we offer a provocative question that is: ""Is there any polynomial function \( f \) such that for every graph \( G \), \( \over"

Title: Deep Learning for Predicting Protein-Protein Interactions,
Abstract: Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are crucial for many cellular processes.
Despite the significant progress in experimental techniques for identifying PPIs,
these methods are often time-consuming and expensive. Computational models
can predict PPIs more efficiently. In this work, we propose a deep learning
approach to predict PPIs from gene expression data. We use long short-term
memory (LSTM) networks to capture temporal dependencies in gene expression
time series and show that our model outperforms existing methods on several
benchmark datasets. Our results demonstrate the potential of deep learning for
discovering novel PPIs.

    Title: Nematic superconductivity in Cu$_{x}$Bi$_{2}$Se$_{3}$: The surface Andreev bound states,
    Abstract: We study theoretically the topological surface states (TSSs) and the possible
    surface Andreev bound states (SABSs) of Cu$_{x}$Bi$_{2}$Se$_{3}$ which is known
    to be a topological insulator at $x=0$. The superconductivity (SC) pairing of
    this compound is assumed to have the broken spin-rotation symmetry, similar to
    that of the A-phase of $^{3}$He as suggested by recent nuclear-magnetic
    resonance experiments. For both spheroidal and corrugated cylindrical Fermi
    surfaces with the hexagonal warping terms, we show that the bulk SC gap is
    rather anisotropic; the minimum of the gap is negligibly small as comparing to
    the maximum of the gap. This would make the fully-gapped pairing effectively
    nodal. For a clean system, our results indicate the bulk of this compound to be
    a topological superconductor with the SABSs appearing"

    Title: Spectral up- and downshifting of Akhmediev breathers under wind forcing,
    Abstract: We experimentally and numerically investigate the effect of wind forcing on the spectral dynamics of Akhmediev breathers, a wave-type known to model the modulation instability. We develop the wind model to the same order in steepness as the higher order modification of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation, also referred to as the Dysthe equation. This results in an asymmetric wind term in the higher order, in addition to the leading order wind forcing term. The derived model is in good agreement with laboratory experiments within the range of the facility's length. We show that the leading order forcing term amplifies all frequencies equally and therefore induces only a broadening of the spectrum while the asymmetric higher order term in the model enhances higher frequencies more than lower ones. Thus, the latter term induces a permanent upshift of the spectral mean. On the other hand, in contrast to the direct effect of wind forcing, wind can indirectly lead to frequency downshifts, due to dissipative effects such as wave breaking, or through amplification of the intrinsic spectral asymmetry of the Dysthe equation. Furthermore, the definitions of the up"

Title: Asymptotic Distribution and Simultaneous Confidence Bands for Ratios of Quantile Functions,
Abstract: Ratio of medians or other suitable quantiles of two distributions is widely
used in medical research to compare treatment and control groups or in
economics to compare various economic variables when repeated cross-sectional
data are available. Inspired by the so-called growth incidence curves
introduced in poverty research, we argue that the ratio of quantile functions
is a more appropriate and informative tool to compare two distributions. We
present an estimator for the ratio of quantile functions and develop
corresponding simultaneous confidence bands, which allow to assess significance
of certain features of the quantile functions ratio. Derived simultaneous
confidence bands rely on the asymptotic distribution of the quantile functions
ratio and do not require re-sampling techniques. The performance of the
simultaneous confidence bands is demonstrated in simulations. Analysis of the
expenditure data from Uganda in years 1999, 2002 and 2005 illustrates the
relevance of our approach."

Title: Total variation regularized non-negative matrix factorization for smooth hyperspectral unmixing,
Abstract: Hyperspectral analysis has gained popularity over recent years as a way to
infer what materials are displayed on a picture whose pixels consist of a
mixture of spectral signatures. Computing both signatures and mixture
coefficients is known as unsupervised unmixing, a set of techniques usually
based on non-negative matrix factorization. Unmixing is a difficult non-convex
problem, and algorithms may converge to one out of many local minima, which may
be far removed from the true global minimum. Computing this true minimum is
NP-hard and seems therefore out of reach. Aiming for interesting local minima,
we investigate the addition of total variation regularization terms. Advantages
of these regularizers are two-fold. Their computation is typically rather
light, and they are deemed to preserve sharp edges in pictures. This paper
describes an algorithm for regularized hyperspectral unmixing based on the
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers.

    Title: Ivanov-Regularised Least-Squares Estimators over Large RKHSs and Their Interpolation Spaces,
    Abstract: We study kernel least-squares estimation under a norm constraint. This form
    of regularisation is known as Ivanov regularisation and it provides better
    control of the norm of the estimator than the well-established Tikhonov
    regularisation. This choice of regularisation allows us to dispose of the
    standard assumption that the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) has a
    Mercer kernel, which is restrictive as it usually requires compactness of the
    covariate set. Instead, we assume only that the RKHS is separable with a
    bounded and measurable kernel. We provide rates of convergence for the expected
    squared $L^2$ error of our estimator under the weak assumption that the
    variance of the response variables is bounded and the unknown regression
    function lies in an interpolation space between $L^2$ and the RKHS. We then
    obtain faster rates of convergence when the regression function is bounded by
    clipping the estimator. In fact, we attain the optimal rate of convergence.

Title: Deep Learning for Predicting Protein-Protein Interactions,
Abstract: In this work, we present a deep learning model for predicting protein-protein interactions (PPIs) using only the primary sequence information of proteins. Our approach leverages the power of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to capture long-range dependencies in sequences, which are crucial for accurate prediction of PPIs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on several benchmark datasets and show that it outperforms existing methods. Additionally, we explore the potential of transfer learning to improve the performance on less studied organisms. Our results suggest that deep learning can significantly advance the field of bioinformatics by providing accurate predictions of PPIs, which is essential for understanding complex biological processes and developing targeted therapies."

    Title: A new Hysteretic Nonlinear Energy Sink (HNES),
    Abstract: The behavior of a new Hysteretic Nonlinear Energy Sink (HNES) coupled to a
    linear primary oscillator is investigated in shock mitigation. Apart from a
    small mass and a nonlinear elastic spring of the Duffing oscillator, the HNES
    is also comprised of a purely hysteretic and a linear elastic spring of
    potentially negative stiffness, connected in parallel. The Bouc-Wen model is
    used to describe the force produced by both the purely hysteretic and linear
    elastic springs. Coupling the primary oscillator with the HNES three nonlinear
    equations of motion are derived, in terms of the two displacements and the
    dimensionless hysteretic variable, which are integrated numerically using the
    analog equation method. The performance of the HNES is examined by quantifying
    the percentage of the initially induced energy in the primary system that is
    passively transferred and dissipated by the HNES. Remarkable results are
    achieved for a wide range of initial input energies. The great performance of
    the HNES is mostly evidenced when the"

Title: Measuring High-Energy Spectra with HAWC,
Abstract: The High-Altitude Water-Cherenkov (HAWC) experiment is a TeV $\gamma$-ray
observatory located \unit[4100]{m} above sea level on the Sierra Negra mountain
in Puebla, Mexico. The detector consists of 300 water-filled tanks, each
instrumented with 4 photomultiplier tubes that utilize the water-Cherenkov
technique to detect atmospheric air showers produced by cosmic $\gamma$ rays.
Construction of HAWC was completed in March of 2015. The experiment's wide
instantaneous field of view (\unit[2]{sr}) and high duty cycle (> 95\%) make it
a powerful survey instrument sensitive to pulsars, supernova remnants, and
other $\gamma$-ray sources. The mechanisms of particle acceleration at these
sources can be studied by analyzing their high-energy spectra. To this end, we
have developed an event-by-event energy-reconstruction algorithm using an
artificial neural network to estimate energies of primary $\gamma$ rays at
HAWC. We will present the details"

Title: Asymptotic Theory for the Maximum of an Increasing Sequence of Parametric Functions,
Abstract: \cite{HillMotegi2017} present a new general asymptotic theory for the maximum
of a random array $\{\mathcal{X}_{n}(i) : 1 \leq i \leq \mathcal{L}\}_{n\geq 1}$, where each $\mathcal{X}_{n}(i)$ is assumed to converge in probability as $n \rightarrow \infty$. The array dimension $\mathcal{L}$ is allowed to increase with the sample size $n$. Existing extreme value theory arguments focus on observed data $\mathcal{X}_{n}(i)$, and require a well-defined limit law for $\max_{1\leq i\leq \mathcal{L}}|\mathcal{X}_{n}(i)|$ by restricting dependence across $i$. The high-dimensional central limit theory literature presumes approximability by a Gaussian law, and also restricts attention to observed data. \cite{HillMotegi2017} do not require $\max_{1\leq i\leq"

Title: Statistical Analysis of Financial Time Series Data Using Wavelets,
Abstract: This paper discusses the application of wavelet transforms in analyzing financial time series data. We explore how wavelets can effectively capture both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends in stock prices. The methodology involves decomposing the time series into different frequency components and then analyzing each component separately. The results show significant improvements in forecasting accuracy compared to traditional methods."

    Title: SOLAR: Deep Structured Latent Representations for Model-Based Reinforcement Learning,
    Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods can be broadly categorized as global model methods, which depend on learning models that provide sensible predictions in a wide range of states, or local model methods, which iteratively refit simple models that are used for policy improvement. While predicting future states that will result from the current actions is difficult, local model methods only attempt to understand system dynamics in the neighborhood of the current policy, making it possible to produce local improvements without ever learning to predict accurately far into the future. The main idea in this paper is that we can learn representations that make it easy to retrospectively infer simple dynamics given the data from the current policy, thus enabling local models to be used for policy learning in complex systems. To that end, we focus on learning representations with probabilistic graphical model (PGM) structure, which allows us to devise an efficient local model method that infers dynamics from real-world rollouts with the PGM as a global prior. We compare our method to other model-based and model-free RL methods on a suite of robotics tasks, including manipulation tasks on a real Sawyer robotic arm directly from camera images."

    Title: Solving 1ODEs with functions,
    Abstract: Here we present a new approach to deal with first order ordinary differential
    equations (1ODEs), presenting functions. This method is an alternative to the
    one we have presented in [1]. In [2], we have established the theoretical
    background to deal, in the extended Prelle-Singer approach context, with
    systems of 1ODEs. In this present paper, we will apply these results in order
    to produce a method that is more efficient in a great number of cases.
    Directly, the solving of 1ODEs is applicable to any problem presenting
    parameters to which the rate of change is related to the parameter itself.
    Apart from that, the solving of 1ODEs can be a part of larger mathematical
    processes vital to dealing with many problems.

    Title: Interactive Reinforcement Learning for Object Grounding via Self-Talking,
    Abstract: Humans are able to identify a referred visual object in a complex scene via a few rounds of natural language communications. Success communication requires both parties to engage and learn to adapt for each other. In this paper, we introduce an interactive training method to improve the natural language conversation system for a visual grounding task. During interactive training, both agents are reinforced by the guidance from a common reward function. The parametrized reward function also cooperatively updates itself via interactions, and contributes to accomplishing the task. We evaluate the method on GuessWhat?! visual grounding task, and significantly improve the task success rate. However, we observe language drifting problem during training and propose to use reward engineering to improve the interpretability for the generated conversations. Our result also indicates evaluating goal-ended visual conversation tasks require semantic relevant metrics beyond task success rate.

    Title: Surface thermophysical properties investigation of the potentially hazardous asteroid (99942) Apophis,
    Abstract: In this work, we investigate the surface thermophysical properties (thermal
emissivity, thermal inertia, roughness fraction and geometric albedo) of
asteroid (99942) Apophis, using the currently available thermal infrared
observations of CanariCam on Gran Telescopio CANARIAS and far-infrared data by
PACS of Herschel, on the basis of the Advanced thermophysical model. We show
that the thermal emissivity of Apophis should be wavelength dependent from
$8.70~\mu m$ to $160~\mu m$, and the maximum emissivity may arise around
$20~\mu m$ similar to that of Vesta. Moreover, we further derive the thermal
inertia, roughness fraction, geometric albedo and effective diameter of Apophis
within a possible 1$\sigma$ scale of

    Title: Various sharp estimates for semi-discrete Riesz transforms of the second order,
    Abstract: We give several sharp estimates for a class of combinations of second order
    Riesz transforms on Lie groups ${G}={G}_{x} \times {G}_{y}$ that are multiply
    connected, composed of a discrete abelian component ${G}_{x}$ and a connected
    component ${G}_{y}$ endowed with a biinvariant measure. These estimates include
    new sharp $L^p$ estimates via Choi type constants, depending upon the
    multipliers of the operator. They also include weak-type, logarithmic and
    exponential estimates. We give an optimal $L^q \to L^p$ estimate as well.
    It was shown recently by Arcozzi, Domelevo and Petermichl that such second
    order Riesz transforms applied to a function may be written as conditional
    expectation of a simple transformation of a stochastic integral associated with
    the function.
    The proofs of our theorems combine this stochastic integral representation
    with a number of deep estimates for pairs of martingales under strong
    differential subordination by Choi, Banuel"

    Title: Passivation and Cooperative Control of Equilibrium-Independent Passivity-Short Systems,
    Abstract: Maximal equilibrium-independent passivity (MEIP) is a recently introduced
    system property which has acquired special attention in the study of networked
    dynamical systems. MEIP requires a system to be passive with respect to any
    forced equilibrium configuration and the associated steady-state input-output
    map must be maximally monotone. In practice, however, most of the systems are
    not well behaved and possess shortage of passivity or non-passiveness in their
    operation. In this paper, we consider a class of passivity-short systems,
    namely equilibrium-independent passivity-short (EIPS) systems, and presents an
    input-output transformation based generalized passivation approach to ensure
    their MEIP properties. We characterize the steady-state input-output relations
    of the EIPS systems and establish their connection with that of the transformed
    MEIP systems. We further study the diffusively-coupled networked interactions
    of such EIPS systems and explore their connection to a pair of dual network
    optimization problems, under the proposed matrix transformation. A simulation
    example is given to"

Title: A Mathematical Model for the Spread of Infectious Diseases in a Population,
Abstract: This paper presents a mathematical model to describe the spread of infectious diseases within a population. The model incorporates various factors such as the rate of infection, recovery rate, and the effect of vaccination. The dynamics of the disease spread are analyzed using differential equations, and the conditions under which an epidemic can occur are derived. Numerical simulations are used to illustrate the behavior of the system under different scenarios, including the impact of varying vaccination rates and initial infection levels. The results provide insights into the effectiveness of different public health interventions in controlling the spread of infectious diseases.

    Title: Anisotropic mechanical and optical response and negative Poissons ratio in Mo2C nanomembranes revealed by first-principles simulations,
    Abstract: Transition metal carbides include a wide variety of materials with attractive
    properties that are suitable for numerous and diverse applications. Most recent
    experimental advance could provide a path toward successful synthesis of
    large-area and high-quality ultrathin Mo2C membranes with superconducting
    properties. In the present study, we used first-principles density functional
    theory calculations to explore the mechanical and optical response of
    single-layer and free-standing Mo2C. Uniaxial tensile simulations along the
    armchair and zigzag directions were conducted and we found that while the
    elastic properties are close along various loading directions, nonlinear
    regimes in stress-strain curves are considerably different. We found that Mo2C
    sheets present negative Poisson's ratio and thus can be categorized as an
    auxetic material. Our simulations also reveal that Mo2C films retain their
    metallic electronic characteristic upon the uniaxial loading. We found that for
    Mo2C nanomembranes the dielectric function becomes"

Title: Capacitated Covering Problems in Geometric Spaces,
Abstract: In this article, we consider the following capacitated covering problem. We
are given a set \( P \) of \( n \) points and a set \( \mathcal{B} \) of balls from some
metric space, and a positive integer \( U \) that represents the capacity of each
of the balls in \( \mathcal{B} \). We would like to compute a subset \( \mathcal{B}' \subseteq \mathcal{B} \) of balls and assign each point in \( P \) to some ball in
\( \mathcal{B} \) that contains it, such that the number of points assigned to any

Title: Bundle Optimization for Multi-aspect Embedding,
Abstract: Understanding semantic similarity among images is the core of a wide range of
computer vision applications. An important step towards this goal is to collect
and learn human perceptions. Interestingly, the semantic context of images is
often ambiguous as images can be perceived with emphasis on different aspects,
which may be contradictory to each other.
In this paper, we present a method for learning the semantic similarity among
images, inferring their latent aspects and embedding them into multi-spaces
corresponding to their semantic aspects.
We consider the multi-embedding problem as an optimization function that
evaluates the embedded distances with respect to the qualitative clustering
queries. The key idea of our approach is to collect and embed qualitative
measures that share the same aspects in bundles. To ensure similarity aspect
sharing among multiple measures, image classification queries are presented to,
and solved by users. The collected image clusters are then converted into
bundles of tuples, which are fed into our bundle optimization algorithm that
jointly infers the aspect similarity and multi-aspect embedding. Extensive
experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art multi-embedding approaches on various datasets, and"

    Title: A Spectroscopic Orbit for the late-type Be star $β$ CMi,
Abstract: The late-type Be star $\beta$ CMi is remarkably stable compared to other Be
stars that have been studied. This has led to a realistic model of the
outflowing Be disk by Klement et al. These results showed that the disk is
likely truncated at a finite radius from the star, which Klement et al.~suggest
is evidence for an unseen binary companion in orbit. Here we report on an
analysis of the Ritter Observatory spectroscopic archive of $\beta$ CMi to
search for evidence of the elusive companion. We detect periodic Doppler shifts
in the wings of the H$\alpha$ line with a period of 170 d and an amplitude of
2.25 km s$^{-1}$, consistent with a low-mass binary companion ($M\approx 0.42
M_\odot$). We then compared the small changes in the violet-to-red peak height
changes ($V/R$) with the orbital motion. We find weak evidence that it does
follow the orbital motion, as suggested by recent Be binary models by Panoglou"

Title: Radio-flaring Ultracool Dwarf Population Synthesis,
Abstract: Over a dozen ultracool dwarfs (UCDs), low-mass objects of spectral types
≥ M7, are known to be sources of radio flares. These typically
several-minutes-long radio bursts can be up to 100\% circularly polarized and
have high brightness temperatures, consistent with coherent emission via the
electron cyclotron maser operating in ∼kG magnetic fields. Recently, the
statistical properties of the bulk physical parameters that describe these UCDs
have become adequately described to permit synthesis of the population of
radio-flaring objects. For the first time, I construct a Monte Carlo simulator
to model the population of these radio-flaring UCDs. This simulator is powered
by Intel Secure Key (ISK)- a new processor technology that uses a local entropy
source to improve random number generation that has heretofore been used to
improve cryptography. The results from this simulator indicate that only
∼5% of radio-flaring UCDs within the local interstellar neighborhood (<25 pc
away) have been discovered. I discuss a number of scenarios which may

    Title: A model of electrical impedance tomography on peripheral nerves for a neural-prosthetic control interface,
    Abstract: Objective: A model is presented to evaluate the viability of using electrical
impedance tomography (EIT) with a nerve cuff to record neural activity in
peripheral nerves. Approach: Established modelling approaches in neural-EIT are
expanded on to be used, for the first time, on myelinated fibres which are
abundant in mammalian peripheral nerves and transmit motor commands. Main
results: Fibre impedance models indicate activity in unmyelinated fibres can be
screened out using operating frequencies above 100 Hz. At 1 kHz and 10 mm
electrode spacing, impedance magnitude of inactive intra-fascicle tissue and
the fraction changes during neural activity are estimated to be 1,142
{\Omega}.cm and -8.8x10-4, respectively, with a transverse current, and 328
{\Omega}.cm & -0.30, respectively with a longitudinal current. We show that a

    Title: Deep Learning for Predicting Protein-Protein Interactions Using Graph Neural Networks,
    Abstract: Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play critical roles in many cellular processes. 
    Accurate prediction of PPIs is important for understanding complex biological systems. 
    Here, we present a deep learning approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) 
    to predict PPIs based on protein sequences and structures. 
    Our model encodes both sequence and structural information into graph representations, 
    and learns interaction patterns through multiple layers of GNNs. 
    We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets and show that it outperforms existing methods. 
    Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of our approach in identifying novel PPIs."

    Title: Deep Learning for Image Super-Resolution,
    Abstract: In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based approach for image super-resolution. The method involves stacking multiple convolutional layers to learn the mapping from low-resolution (LR) images to high-resolution (HR) images. We introduce a novel residual learning framework that effectively addresses the vanishing gradient problem during training. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both subjective visual quality and objective metrics. Additionally, we explore the application of our approach in various scenarios, including face enhancement and medical imaging.

    Title: Personalized Driver Stress Detection with Multi-task Neural Networks using Physiological Signals,
    Abstract: Stress can be seen as a physiological response to everyday emotional, mental and physical challenges. A long-term exposure to stressful situations can have negative health consequences, such as increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and immune system disorder. Therefore, a timely stress detection can lead to systems for better management and prevention in future circumstances. In this paper, we suggest a multi-task learning based neural network approach (with hard parameter sharing of mutual representation and task-specific layers) for personalized stress recognition using skin conductance and heart rate from wearable devices. The proposed method is tested on multi-modal physiological responses collected during real-world and simulator driving tasks.
