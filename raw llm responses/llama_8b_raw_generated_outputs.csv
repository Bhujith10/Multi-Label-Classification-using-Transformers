Title: Solving the multi-site and multi-orbital Dynamical Mean Field Theory using Density Matrix Renormalization,
Abstract: We implement an efficient numerical method to calculate response functions of
complex impurities based on the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) and
use it as the impurity-solver of the Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT). This
method uses the correction vector to obtain precise Green's functions on the
real frequency axis at zero temperature. By using a self-consistent bath
configuration with very low entanglement, we take full advantage of the DMRG to
calculate dynamical response functions paving the way to treat large effective
impurities such as those corresponding to multi-orbital interacting models and
multi-site or multi-momenta clusters. This method leads to reliable
calculations of non-local self energies at arbitrary dopings and interactions
and at any energy scale."

Abstract: This paper proposes a data-driven approach to simulate and evaluate the effectiveness of attacks on black-box machine learning classifiers in adversarial domains. The Seed-Explore-Exploit framework is presented as a formal adversarial model, allowing for the generation of data-driven and reverse engineering attacks. Experimental results on 10 real-world datasets demonstrate the vulnerabilities of classifiers and the ease with which evasion can be carried out, without any explicit information about the classifier type, training data, or application domain."

Abstract: In the following text we prove that for all finite $p\geq0$ there exists a
topological graph $X$ such that $\{p,p+1,p+2,\ldots\}\cup\{+\infty\}$ is the
collection of all possible heights for transformation groups with phase space
$X$. Moreover for all topological graph $X$ with $p$ as height of
transformation group $(Homeo(X),X)$, $\{p,p+1,p+2,\ldots\}\cup\{+\infty\}$
again is the collection of all possible heights for transformation groups with
phase space $X$."

" phenomenological modeling of the agents and the objects, which is used to obtain the transition system. 

Keywords: multi-agent systems, temporal logic, control protocols, motion planning, cooperative transportation.

The proposed control protocols are designed to allow the transition of the agents as well as the cooperative transportation of the objects by the agents, among predefined regions of interest in the workspace.
The transition system is a finite abstraction of the coupled behavior of the agents and the objects, which is used to obtain the transition system.
The high-level multi-agent plan is designed to satisfy the agents' and the objects' specifications, given as temporal logic formulas.

The proposed framework is verified through simulation results.

The framework is designed to work with N robotic agents and M objects in the workspace.

The paper focuses on the design of control protocols for multi-agent systems under temporal logic formulas.
The proposed framework is a hybrid control framework that combines discrete and continuous control methods.
The control protocols are designed to allow the transition of the agents and the objects in the workspace.
The framework is verified through simulation results.

This paper presents a hybrid control framework for the motion planning of a multi-agent system including N robotic agents and M objects, under high level goals expressed as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas.

Keywords: LDPC codes, correlated sources, EXIT charts, iterative decoding,
capacity approaching ensembles.

This paper presents a novel approach to design capacity approaching ensembles
of LDPC codes for correlated sources. The proposed approach uses EXIT charts
to analyze the asymptotic performance of the designed ensembles and to
determine the thresholds corresponding to these ensembles. The results show
that the designed ensembles can achieve a good trade-off between the
computational complexity of the decoder and the performance of the designed

"holes in the process and reduce editors workloads, are treated as trade secrets by
publishing houses and are not shared publicly. To improve the effectiveness of
their strategies, editors in small publishing groups are faced with undertaking
an iterative trial-and-error approach. We show that Cartesian Genetic
Programming, a nature-inspired evolutionary algorithm, can dramatically improve
editorial strategies. The artificially evolved strategy reduced the duration of
the peer review process by 30%, without increasing the pool of reviewers (in
comparison to a typical human-developed strategy). Evolutionary computation has
typically been used in technological processes or biological ecosystems. Our
results demonstrate that genetic programs can improve real-world social systems
that are usually much harder to understand and control than physical systems."
