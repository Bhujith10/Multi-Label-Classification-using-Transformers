Title: Deep Learning for Predicting Protein-Protein Interactions from Protein Sequences,
Abstract: Understanding how proteins interact with each other is crucial for
understanding the functioning of living organisms. In this paper, we use deep
learning to predict whether two proteins will interact based on their amino
acid sequences. We propose a novel neural network architecture called
InteractionNet that can learn protein interaction features directly from raw
protein sequence data. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
PPI prediction task using only sequence information, outperforming previous
methods that require additional feature engineering. Our results suggest that
deep learning approaches have great potential for predicting protein-protein
interactions and understanding protein function."

Title: Anisotropic diffusion and image denoising,
Abstract: We present a new method for image denoising based on anisotropic diffusion
of the image. Our method uses the heat equation with variable conductivity to
smooth the image while preserving edges. The key idea is to define a
conduction tensor that depends on the local gradient orientation. The tensor is
constructed using a principal component analysis of the gradient direction over
a small neighborhood. This allows the diffusion to be aligned locally with the
image features, thereby enhancing them while removing noise. We show that our
method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of PSNR and visual
quality."

Title: A Simple Proof of the Uniqueness of the Gaussian Free Field,
Abstract: The Gaussian free field (GFF) is a fundamental object of probability theory
and statistical mechanics. It is well known to be unique in dimension d=2, but
not in higher dimensions. In this note we give a short proof of the uniqueness
of the GFF in dimension d=2. Our argument relies on the fact that the GFF is
the unique solution of a certain variational problem."

Title: On the Performance of the Inverse Distance Weighting Method for Spatial Interpolation of Rainfall Events,
Abstract: Spatial interpolation of rainfall events is an important tool for the
planning and management of water resources. This study evaluates the performance
of the inverse distance weighting (IDW) method for interpolating daily rainfall
events over the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The IDW method was used to
interpolate 10-year daily rainfall events at 279 rain gauge stations for the
period from 1996 to 2005. The results were compared with those obtained using
the ordinary kriging (OK) method, which is considered to be the best among the
classical geostatistical methods. The performance of both methods was evaluated
using the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and the
fractional bias (FB). The results show that the IDW method performs better than
the OK method for the majority of the rain gauges. In addition, the IDW method
produces more homogeneous maps with respect to the OK method. These results
suggest that the IDW method could be a good alternative for spatially"

Title: A new approach to the study of the dynamics of the quadratic family,
Abstract: We present a new approach to the study of the dynamics of the quadratic map
$f_a(z)=z^2+a$ where $a\in \mathbb{C}$. This approach allows us to obtain new
results about the dynamics of $f_a$, in particular about the Julia sets of
$f_a$. We prove that the Julia set of $f_a$ has no interior points if and only
if the boundary of the basin of attraction of infinity of $f_a$ is not dense
in the Julia set. Moreover, we also prove that the boundary of the basin of
attraction of infinity of $f_a$ is dense in the Julia set if and only if the
Julia set of $f_a$ is a Cantor set. Finally, we give a new proof of the fact
that the boundary of the basin of attraction of infinity of $f_a$ is not dense
in the Julia set if $a$ belongs to the closure of the Mandelbrot set."

Title: On the Power of Over-parametrization in Neural Networks with Quadratic Activation,
Abstract: We provide theoretical guarantees on the ability of over-parametrized
neural networks with quadratic activation to interpolate data and perform
generalization. In particular, we consider a simple two-layer network with
$n$ parameters trained to fit $m$ training points exactly. When the number of
parameters $n$ is at least proportional to the number of points $m$, we show
that there exists a choice of weights in the network such that the prediction
error is zero on the training set and the $\ell_2$ norm of the weights is
bounded by a constant independent of $n$ and $m$. Our result holds for any
labeling of the data points and for any value of the regularization parameter.
Furthermore, we show that this phenomenon persists even when the data is noisy
and the labels do not agree with the true underlying function. We complement
our theoretical results with empirical evidence showing that over-parametrized
two layer neural networks can generalize well on synthetic and real data
datasets."

We also show that the recombination process could be exploited to detect the
presence of a charged particle in the detector, as well as to discriminate
between the muons and the electrons. We propose an algorithm which can be used
to discriminate between the muon and electron tracks, with a good efficiency
and a low contamination. We also discuss the possibility to use the recombination
process to identify the tracks of particles with a high energy deposition in
the detector."

Title: FLAME: A Fast Large-scale Almost Matching Exactly Approach to Causal Inference,
Abstract: A classical problem in causal inference is that of matching, where
treatment units need to be matched to control units. Some of the main
challenges in developing matching methods arise from the tension among (i)
inclusion of as many covariates as possible in defining the matched groups, (ii)
having matched groups with enough treated and control units for a valid
estimate of Average Treatment Effect (ATE) in each group, and (iii) computing
the matched pairs efficiently for large datasets. In this paper we propose a
fast method for approximate and exact matching in causal analysis called FLAME
(Fast Large-scale Almost Matching Exactly). We define an optimization
objective for match quality, which gives preferences to matching on covariates
that can be useful for predicting the outcome while encouraging as many matches
as possible. FLAME aims to optimize our match quality measure, leveraging
techniques that are natural for query processing in the area of database
management. We provide two implementations of FLAME using SQL queries and bit-
vector techniques."

Title: Towards Real-time Object Detection on Mobile Devices using MobileNet,
Abstract: We present a new mobile object detection system that is capable of running
in real-time on modern mobile devices. Our system uses the MobileNet CNN for
detection and the SSD framework for inference. We show that the MobileNet CNN
can achieve comparable accuracy to the VGG16 network while being orders of
magnitude smaller and faster. This enables us to run object detection on mobile
devices in real-time, with the same accuracy as a desktop GPU. To demonstrate
the usefulness of our system, we provide an implementation of a real-time
object detection system for Android phones and tablets. This allows users to
annotate objects in real-time as they appear in their surroundings. We show
that this can be used for crowd counting and activity recognition, and discuss
its potential applications."

Title: On the convergence rate of the Expectation Maximization algorithm for log-concave mixtures of two Gaussian distributions,
Abstract: We prove that, under mild assumptions, the Expectation Maximization
(EM) algorithm converges linearly at rate $1/2$ towards the global maximum of
the likelihood function associated with a mixture of two Gaussian distributions
with different means, when the number of observations tends to infinity. This
result holds true even if the variance of the components is unknown. The proof
relies on the fact that the EM algorithm converges linearly towards a
subgradient of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the unknown distribution
and the target Gaussian mixture. This allows us to establish the desired
convergence rate by showing that the sequence of iterates of the EM algorithm
converges linearly towards the global maximum of the likelihood function. We
also provide an upper bound on the number of iterations required by the EM
algorithm to reach a neighborhood of the global maximum of the likelihood
function. Finally, we show how our results can be used to analyze the behavior
of the EM algorithm in practice, and illustrate this analysis using simulated
data."

Title: Theoretical study of the electron-phonon coupling in cuprates,
Abstract: We present a theoretical analysis of the electron-phonon coupling in
cuprates. We use the dynamical mean field theory to calculate the
electron-phonon coupling constant $g$ and the renormalization of the quasiparticle
weight $Z$. We show that $g$ and $Z$ depend strongly on the temperature and
chemical potential. The results are compared with recent experimental data on
the temperature dependence of $g$ in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$ and La$_2$CuO$_4$
using the $g$ factor of the nuclear spin of the oxygen atom. The values of $g$
and $Z$ are also calculated for the optimally doped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6.9}$
using the $g$ factor of the $^{57}$Fe nuclear spin in the presence of a
magnetic field. We find that the electron-phonon coupling is larger at lower
temperature and smaller chemical potential, which is consistent with the
experimental data. Our results suggest that the electron-phonon coupling"

Title: Quantum Control of Bose-Einstein Condensates in Trapped Optical Lattices,
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in a
quasi-one-dimensional optical lattice, in the presence of a magnetic field and
a time-dependent laser potential. Using a combination of analytical and
numerical techniques, we show that this system exhibits rich and complex
dynamics, including the formation of multiple solitons, vortex-antivortex pairs
and topological defects, and the occurrence of oscillatory and chaotic regimes.
We also find that the dynamics can be controlled via external control fields.
These results suggest that this system could be used to simulate and explore
complex quantum phenomena."

Title: Overcoming the Sign Problem at Finite Temperature: Quantum Tensor Network for the Orbital $e_g$ Model on an Infinite Square Lattice,
Abstract: The variational tensor network renormalization approach to two-dimensional
(2D) quantum systems at finite temperature is applied for the first time to a
model suffering the notorious quantum Monte Carlo sign problem --- the orbital
$e_g$ model with spatially highly anisotropic orbital interactions.
Coarse-graining of the tensor network along the inverse temperature $\beta$
yields a numerically tractable 2D tensor network representing the Gibbs state.
Its bond dimension $D$ --- limiting the amount of entanglement --- is a natural
refinement parameter. Increasing $D$ we obtain a converged order parameter and
its linear susceptibility close to the critical point. They confirm the
existence of finite order parameter below the critical temperature $T_c$,
provide a numerically exact estimate of~$T_c$, and give the critical exponents
within $1\%$ of the 2D Ising universality class."

Title: Learning to Generate Text with Latent Constraints,
Abstract: We present a method for learning to generate text that satisfies latent
constraints, i.e., constraints that are not explicitly defined but instead
implicitly defined via a reward function. This is achieved by incorporating
latent constraint satisfaction into the training objective of a generative
model. Our method, Latent Constraint Learning (LCL), is simple and general and
can be used to learn latent constraints over arbitrary properties of generated
text. We demonstrate LCL on three tasks: (i) generating realistic names that
satisfy gender-specific length distributions, (ii) generating realistic reviews
that satisfy user-specified sentiment, and (iii) generating realistic sentences
that satisfy user-specified syntactic structure. On each of these tasks, LCL
outperforms existing methods that require the explicit definition of
constraints."

Title: A New Approach to Non-Linear Data Fitting Using the Generalized Cross-Validation Method,
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new approach to non-linear data fitting using
the generalized cross-validation method. We show that the solution of this
problem can be found by solving a nonlinear equation which is similar to the
normal equation used in the least-squares problem. Furthermore, we show that
this nonlinear equation can be solved by Newton's method and also by a
modified version of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. Finally, we show that
the proposed method is comparable with other methods in terms of accuracy and
computational cost."
